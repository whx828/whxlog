Long-term stress is bad for you in almost every way. Stress decreases the amount of information you can hold in mind (what psychologists call _working memory_). Stress makes it harder to concentrate. It also has long-term health consequences and disrupts your ability to sleep.

长期的压力几乎在各个方面都对你有害。压力会减少你记忆中的信息量(心理学家称之为工作记忆)。压力使人更难集中注意力。它也有长期的健康后果，扰乱你的睡眠能力。

Yet, there is a straightforward and simple remedy for stress that few people take advantage of: keeping a journal.

然而，对于压力，有一个很少有人利用的简单明了的补救办法: 坚持写日记。

My colleague [Jamie Pennebaker](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-12208-011) has done quite a bit of work on the role of a particular kind of journaling—expressive writing—on stress. When you experience negative events in life, whether at home or at work, those events stick with you. There is good reason to want to remember the bad things that have happened. Reflecting on those moments can help you plan for the future to ensure they don’t happen again.

我的同事杰米•彭尼贝克(Jamie Pennebaker)在压力日志的一种特殊类型——表达性写作——的角色方面做了不少工作。当你在生活中经历负面事件时，无论是在家里还是在工作中，这些事件都会伴随着你。我们有充分的理由去记住已经发生的不好的事情。反思这些时刻可以帮助你计划未来，确保它们不会再次发生。

But, if you keep thinking about them repeatedly (a process that psychologists call _rumination_ for the word used to describe cows chewing their cud), those thoughts can provoke anxiety and stress. Over the long-term that stress hurts.

但是，如果你不断地反复思考这些问题(心理学家称这个过程为反刍，用来形容反刍的奶牛) ，这些想法可能会引起焦虑和压力。从长远来看，压力会带来伤害。

Writing about those events and how they make you feel can help. The idea is to keep a regular journal. When you have a bad experience in your personal or professional life, write about it a few times. When you write about it, describe the event in detail. Write about how it made you feel. Write about what you might do about it in the future. Devote 20-30 minutes to writing about events that really bother you.

写下这些事件以及它们给你带来的感受会有所帮助。这样做的目的是经常写日记。当你在个人生活或职业生涯中遇到不好的经历时，写上几次。当你写它的时候，详细描述一下这件事。写下它给你带来的感受。写下你将来可能做的事情。花20-30分钟写一些真正困扰你的事情。

In the moment, that kind of writing can be painful. At work, you might make a big mistake and then get chewed-out by your boss in front of other colleagues. Following that error, you might be angry with yourself, embarrassed at being yelled at, and even feel shame. When you write about that event later, you will re-experience a lot of those emotions in ways that won’t be fun.

在那一刻，那种写作可能是痛苦的。在工作中，你可能会犯一个大错误，然后在其他同事面前被老板训斥。如果你犯了这个错误，你可能会对自己感到愤怒，对别人的吼叫感到尴尬，甚至感到羞愧。当你以后写那件事的时候，你将会以一种不好玩的方式重新体验那些情绪。

But, the effects of this writing are powerful. They get a lot of those thoughts out of your head and onto paper. Your brain will not feel like it has to keep those thoughts rattling around in your head if you have already gotten them outside of yourself. In addition, the bad things that happen to you create little tears in the fabric of your life story. By writing about those events several times, you craft a story that knits the bad things into the narrative of your life. The more that these events become coherent to you, the less likely that they will be a source of later rumination.

但是，这种写作的效果是强大的。他们从你的大脑中获得了很多这样的想法，并把它们写在纸上。如果你已经把这些想法从你自己身上拿走了，你的大脑就不会感觉到它必须让这些想法在你的脑海里不停地跳动。此外，发生在你身上的坏事会在你的人生故事中留下一点点眼泪。通过多次写下这些事件，你编织了一个故事，把不好的事情编织成你生活的叙述。这些事件对你来说越连贯，它们就越不可能成为后来反思的来源。

By the way, you don’t have to keep your journal. The writing process is the active ingredient in this benefit of writing. If you write on paper, you can shred or burn the pages later. If you write on your computer, you can delete the files. Don’t feel like you have to keep the pages and read them later. That said, you may want to hold onto your journal for the long-term to look back on the aspects of your personal and work life that were sources of stress for you earlier in your life.

顺便说一句，你不必坚持写日记。写作的过程就是写作的原料药。如果你写在纸上，你可以稍后撕碎或者烧掉这些页面。如果你在电脑上写，你可以删除这些文件。不要觉得你必须保留这些页面，然后再阅读它们。也就是说，你可能需要长期保留你的日记，回顾一下你的个人生活和工作生活中那些早期给你带来压力的方面。

Over time, you should find that your stress levels go down. You’ll sleep better and be more resilient to the small things that can go wrong each day. Your relationships at home and at work will improve. On top of that, you’ll find it easier to concentrate at work—and that will help you get more done. Finally, with lower stress about problems that have happened at work, you’ll feel more confident to dive into new and difficult projects and to share your opinions with colleagues.

随着时间的推移，你会发现你的压力水平下降了。你会睡得更好，对每天可能出错的小事也更有弹性。你在家庭和工作中的关系会得到改善。最重要的是，你会发现在工作中更容易集中注意力ーー这会帮助你完成更多的工作。最后，工作中发生的问题带来的压力越小，你就越有信心投入到新的和困难的项目中，并与同事分享你的观点。
