	- 当人们在某一时刻决定不使用某件东西时，这件东西就会开始让人感觉更加特别。因为它感觉更特别，他们想要保护它，并且不太可能在未来使用它。
		- 应对之策：享受当下。

	- Don’t face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don’t know. Then see what’s missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notions. There are degrees to understanding (it’s not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success.

	  1. Do not compete
	  If there are many jobless painters in the market, do not make painting your job. If you like to paint, please paint! but do not make it your job.
	  2. Escape big cities and Go Remote
	  I started doing remote-only contracting in 2014, and I had doubts about its sustainability. Then the pandemic came, and now I only find remote job offers in my inbox. If you think your company is not gonna accept it, change company. Also, they will be forced to change in the next ten years. I think Remote-Only work, like Electric cars, is happening way faster than people think.
	  3. Compound 
	  If you invest €100 in some asset that returns 5% per year, after the first year you will have €105. The following year you won't have €110, but €110.25. That tiny difference is the real way to get rich. People don't take that tiny difference seriously enough. In 10 years that tiny difference will make all the difference.
	  In general, if you have P amount of money, and invest in something that returns r every year, after n years you will have: 
	  $$P(1+r)^n$$ 
	  That's an exponential function. People that get wealthy take a sit on the exponential function ride, while regular people lose to inflation. You don't need to do much, nor to be clever. Just take a sit on the exponential ride.
