	- 当人们在某一时刻决定不使用某件东西时，这件东西就会开始让人感觉更加特别。因为它感觉更特别，他们想要保护它，并且不太可能在未来使用它。
		- 应对之策：享受当下。

	- Don’t face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don’t know. Then see what’s missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notions. There are degrees to understanding (it’s not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success.

	  1. Do not compete
	  If there are many jobless painters in the market, do not make painting your job. If you like to paint, please paint! but do not make it your job.
	  2. Escape big cities and Go Remote
	  I started doing remote-only contracting in 2014, and I had doubts about its sustainability. Then the pandemic came, and now I only find remote job offers in my inbox. If you think your company is not gonna accept it, change company. Also, they will be forced to change in the next ten years. I think Remote-Only work, like Electric cars, is happening way faster than people think.
	  3. Compound 
	  If you invest €100 in some asset that returns 5% per year, after the first year you will have €105. The following year you won't have €110, but €110.25. That tiny difference is the real way to get rich. People don't take that tiny difference seriously enough. In 10 years that tiny difference will make all the difference.
	  In general, if you have P amount of money, and invest in something that returns r every year, after n years you will have: 
	  $$P(1+r)^n$$ 
	  That's an exponential function. People that get wealthy take a sit on the exponential function ride, while regular people lose to inflation. You don't need to do much, nor to be clever. Just take a sit on the exponential ride. 
	  
	  Probably the most important trick is this: build a public online profile. A website, or a blog where you show at least a couple of side projects (websites, apps, GitHub projects) and previous work experiences. Portfolio matters: in this business companies really don’t care much about your Degrees, as much as your Portfolio. It’s not easy to be considered Senior, but the demand for skilled developers has been rampant since the 90s. So, if you can show something you’ve built and deployed on your own, you’re very well positioned. Decent spoken English matters as well, but I’ve met many remote professionals that built a solid remote career without being Shakespeare. 
	  Once you have a visible public profile, if you find it hard to get into networks like Toptal, you can instead go for Permanent roles at remote-first companies. There is now plenty, and you can find them via websites like remoteok.io or weworkremotely.com. 
	  Submitting your CV / Portfolio directly to the “Careers” page is surprisingly effective. Tweak your portfolio, show what you have done, submit a lot of CVs to many companies over months, try again and again.

	- 最重要的诀窍可能是：建立一个公开的网上档案。一个网站，或一个博客，在那里你至少展示几个副业项目（网站、应用程序、GitHub项目）和以前的工作经验。投资组合很重要：在这个行业中，公司真的不怎么在乎你的学位，而是在乎你的投资组合。要被认为是高级人才并不容易，但自90年代以来，对熟练开发人员的需求一直很旺盛。
	  因此，如果你能展示你自己建立和部署的东西，你就会有很好的地位。体面的英语口语也很重要，但我遇到过许多远程专业人士，他们在没有莎士比亚的情况下建立了坚实的远程事业。
	  一旦你有了明显的公众形象，如果你发现很难进入像 Toptal 这样的网络公司，你可以转而在远程优先的公司中寻找永久职位。现在有很多，你可以通过 remoteok.io 或 weworkremotely.com 等网站找到它们。 
	  将你的简历/作品集直接提交到 "职业 "页面是令人惊讶的有效方式。调整你的作品集，展示你所做的事情，在几个月内向许多公司提交大量的简历，一次又一次地尝试。
