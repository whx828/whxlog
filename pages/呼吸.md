# What’s stressing you out at work? The pressure? The pandemic? The pinging apps? Could it also be the way you breathe?
什么让你在工作中感到压力？压力？疫情？ pinging应用程序？有没有想过也可能是你呼吸的方式？
- Although we’re mostly unaware of it, we breathe in and out about 25,000 times a day. And many of us are doing it wrong. This is the conclusion journalist James Nestor came to after talking to breathing experts and enthusiasts around the world—and he was doing it wrong, too.
  尽管我们大多不知道，但我们每天呼吸大约 25,000 次。我们很多人都做错了。这是记者 James Nestor 在与世界各地的呼吸专家和爱好者交谈后得出的结论——他也做错了。
- “There are as many ways to breathe as there are foods to eat,” a female freediving instructor told Nestor. “And each way we breathe will affect our bodies in different ways.” He was inclined to believe her knowing that she could hold her breath for more than eight minutes and dive unaided below 300 feet.
  “呼吸就像吃东西，”一位女性自由潜水教练告诉内斯特。 “我们呼吸的每一种方式都会以不同的方式影响我们的身体。”他倾向于相信她知道，她可以屏住呼吸超过 8 分钟，并且可以在 300 英尺以下无人帮助的情况下潜水。
- Nestor recently published Breath, The New Science of a Lost Art, a deep plunge into the world of “pulmonauts,” his term for people, like freedivers, who explore the bounds of human lung capacity and the health benefits of breath control.
  Nestor 最近出版了 Breath，The New Science of a Lost Art，深入了解“pulmonauts”的世界，这是他对自由潜水员等探索人类肺活量极限和呼吸控制对健康益处的人的称呼。
## Inhale吸入
- Breathing, Nestor discovered, isn’t just a biological function that we depend on to survive. It’s also a very useful tool for healing the body and focusing the mind. “It’s a technology,” he writes, “our own species has been perfecting with only our lips, noses, and lungs for hundreds of thousands of years.” And it’s a technology that is increasingly relevant to our overstimulated digital lives, both at home and at work.
  内斯特发现，呼吸不仅仅是我们赖以生存的生物功能。它也是治愈身体和集中精神的非常有用的工具。 “这是一项技术，”他写道，“数十万年来，我们自己的物种一直在完善我们的嘴唇、鼻子和肺。”这是一项与我们过度刺激的家庭和工作数字生活越来越相关的技术。
- We inhale to bring oxygen into the body to fuel our movements and feed our brains. When we’re in danger, we breathe faster, which sets off a whole chain of chemical processes that enable us to fight or take flight. Our heart rate naturally increases with each inhale and decreases with each exhale. When our breathing rate increases, the heart pumps faster to deliver the extra oxygen. The body also produces more cortisol, the stress hormone that both increases glucose in our bloodstreams (which combines with oxygen for quick bursts of energy) while also inhibiting dopamine and serotonin, the counterbalancing hormones that promote feelings of calm and well-being.
  我们吸气是为了将氧气带入体内，为我们的运动提供动力并滋养我们的大脑。当我们处于危险之中时，我们会呼吸得更快，这会引发一整套化学过程，使我们能够战斗或逃跑。我们的心率自然会随着每次吸气而增加，随着每次呼气而减少。当我们的呼吸频率增加时，心脏泵血速度加快以输送额外的氧气。身体还会产生更多的皮质醇，这种压力荷尔蒙会增加我们血液中的葡萄糖（与氧气结合以提供快速的能量爆发），同时还会抑制多巴胺和血清素，这是促进平静和幸福感的平衡荷尔蒙。
- The direction of causality here is important. Breathing is both an automatic function and a voluntary one. Humans discovered long ago, first intuitively and then systematically, that they could hack their bodies with their breath. “We can't control our kidney function, or our liver function, or our stomachs,” says Nestor, “but by controlling our breathing, we can influence all those functions.” Breathing affects how we feel, but we can also use it to change how we feel.
  这里因果关系的方向很重要。呼吸既是一种自动功能，也是一种自愿功能。人类很久以前就发现，首先是凭直觉，然后是系统地，他们可以用呼吸来砍断自己的身体。 “我们无法控制我们的肾功能、肝功能或胃，”内斯特说，“但通过控制我们的呼吸，我们可以影响所有这些功能。”呼吸会影响我们的感觉，但我们也可以用它来改变我们的感觉。
- Increased oxygen causes the blood vessels to contract. Consuming that oxygen causes them to dilate, as CO₂ levels rise. This play of vascular pressure feeds back to the heart, which makes minute adjustments to its rhythms to make sure, moment by moment, the body is getting the oxygen it needs. When this is operating properly we have good heart rate variability, an important measure of physical fitness.
  氧气增加导致血管收缩。随着二氧化碳水平的升高，消耗氧气会导致它们膨胀。这种血管压力的作用会反馈到心脏，心脏会对其节律进行微调，以确保身体每时每刻都能获得所需的氧气。当它正常运行时，我们有良好的心率变异性，这是衡量身体健康的重要指标。
- “The people who are healthiest are the ones who can immediately turn on their stress—and quickly turn it off.” —James Nestor
  “最健康的人是能够立即释放压力并迅速关闭压力的人。” ——詹姆斯·内斯特
- “That’s really how we’re programmed,” says Nestor. “To be on, and to be able to turn on very quickly. But most importantly, you want to be able to turn off. The people who are healthiest are the ones who can immediately turn on their stress—and quickly turn it off.” Unfortunately, most of us are not in such great shape. “Once we feel anxiety,” he continues, “it can take more than an hour for us to come back down to our normal resting level.” 
  “这就是我们的编程方式，”内斯特说。 “要开启，并且能够很快开启。但最重要的是，您希望能够关闭。最健康的人是那些能够立即打开压力并迅速关闭压力的人。”不幸的是，我们中的大多数人都没有那么好。 “一旦我们感到焦虑，”他继续说道，“我们可能需要一个多小时才能恢复到正常的休息水平。”
- For 21st century digitally augmented humans, that life preserving jolt of cortisol has turned into something else. “Everything has become a perceived threat. Looking at the news 20 times a day,” says Nestor, “it’s this constant drip of stress into our lives, which is extremely injurious to our health.” 
  对于 21 世纪的数字增强人类来说，皮质醇的维持生命的震动已经变成了其他东西。 “一切都已成为一种感知威胁。每天看 20 次新闻，”内斯特说，“这是我们生活中持续不断的压力，这对我们的健康非常有害。”
## Exhale呼气
- Just as our inhale amps us up, our exhale calms us back down. We can use this simple fact to great effect. When your inhale is longer than your exhale, your heart speeds up; when your exhale is longer, it slows down. “If you’re stressed out at work,” Nestor explains, “the easiest thing you can do with breathing is to exhale more than you're inhaling.”
  正如我们的吸气使我们振作起来，我们的呼气使我们平静下来。我们可以使用这个简单的事实来产生巨大的效果。当你的吸气时间长于呼气时间时，你的心跳会加快；当你的呼气变长时，它会变慢。 “如果你在工作中感到压力很大，”内斯特解释说，“你可以用呼吸做的最简单的事情就是呼气多于吸气。”
- Many of the experts Nestor consulted believe that most people inhale too much. In our anxiety and distraction, with bad posture and laptops propped on kitchen tables, we gasp for air as if we were drowning.
  内斯特咨询过的许多专家认为，大多数人吸入过多。在我们的焦虑和分心中，不良姿势和笔记本电脑支撑在厨房的桌子上，我们像溺水一样喘着粗气。
- “The trigger for breathing,” Nestor says, “is not oxygen, it's CO₂. When CO₂ goes up, we feel we need to breathe.” So, paradoxically, although it’s the inhale that we’re most aware of, it’s the exhale that gives us the most control. 
  “呼吸的触发因素，”内斯特说，“不是氧气，而是二氧化碳。当二氧化碳上升时，我们觉得我们需要呼吸。”因此，矛盾的是，虽然我们最了解的是吸气，但最能控制我们的是呼气。
- Many breathing practices use physical or mental devices to help us balance our inhales with our exhales. For instance, in yoga, many of the asanas are practiced with an inhale on the rising movement followed by an exhale for the lowering one. Your body understands the symmetry of the movements and transfers that balance to the breath.
  许多呼吸练习使用身体或心理设备来帮助我们平衡吸气和呼气。例如，在瑜伽中，许多体式的练习都是在上升动作时吸气，然后在下降动作时呼气。您的身体了解运动的对称性，并将这种平衡转移到呼吸中。
- Knowledge work, though mentally taxing, doesn’t engage the body in such a direct way, so there’s generally no reason to let your stress-inducing inhalations dominate your relaxation-oriented exhalations. There are exceptions, like getting yourself psyched up for a presentation, but mostly we need to work on calming ourselves down.
  知识工作虽然在精神上很费力，但不会以如此直接的方式让身体参与其中，所以通常没有理由让你的压力吸入主导你的放松导向的呼气。也有例外，比如让自己为演讲而兴奋，但大多数情况下，我们需要努力让自己冷静下来。
- “You get more oxygen by breathing slower… breathing slowly when you’re working on stuff will help you focus.” —James Nestor
  “通过缓慢呼吸可以获得更多氧气……当你在做事情时缓慢呼吸将帮助你集中注意力。” ——詹姆斯·内斯特
- The simplest and most effective way to do this is to consciously slow your rate of breathing. Remember, CO₂ is not your enemy. It actually helps your body, and particularly your brain, utilize oxygen more effectively by opening the blood vessels. By studying high-performing athletes like mountain climbers and freedivers Nestor discovered the power of slow breathing. “You get more oxygen by breathing slower,” he says. “This so contradictory, it take took me a long time to really figure out, but breathing slowly when you’re working on stuff will help you focus.”
  做到这一点最简单、最有效的方法是有意识地减慢呼吸速度。请记住，二氧化碳不是您的敌人。它实际上可以通过打开血管来帮助您的身体，尤其是您的大脑更有效地利用氧气。通过对登山运动员和自由潜水员等高水平运动员的研究，内斯特发现了缓慢呼吸的力量。 “呼吸变慢，你可以获得更多氧气，”他说。 “这太矛盾了，我花了很长时间才弄明白，但是当你在做事情的时候慢慢呼吸会帮助你集中注意力。”
## The perfect breath 完美的呼吸
- Many of the world’s spiritual traditions have practices that train the mind to both slow respiration and even it out. Instead of thinking about breath in binary terms, in or out, these practices encourage a view of breathing as a continuous gesture—the inhale flowing into the exhale, and so on. 
  世界上的许多精神传统都有训练思想来减缓呼吸甚至使呼吸平稳的做法。这些练习不是以二元的方式考虑呼吸，吸气或呼气，而是鼓励将呼吸视为一种连续的姿势——吸气流入呼气，等等。
- One concise description of the yogic practice of pranayama suggests conceiving of your breath as an upright ellipsis: “The actual pattern of breathing is elliptical rather than circular. That means there is more time spent during the inhalation and exhalation phases than during the transitions between the two.”
  对 pranayama 瑜伽练习的一个简明描述建议将您的呼吸视为一个直立的省略号：“实际的呼吸模式是椭圆形而不是圆形。这意味着在吸气和呼气阶段花费的时间比在两者之间的过渡期间花费的时间要多。”
- This ideal breath, to riff on Madonna, is just like a prayer. Nestor points to a 2001 Italian study that concluded, “We serendipitously discovered that reciting the Ave Maria prayer and yoga mantras enhances and synchronizes inherent cardiovascular rhythms because it slows respiration to almost exactly six respirations per minute, which is essentially the same timing as that of endogenous circulatory rhythms.”
  这种理想的呼吸，对麦当娜进行即兴演奏，就像祈祷一样。 Nestor 指出 2001 年意大利的一项研究得出的结论是：“我们意外地发现，背诵 Ave Maria 祈祷和瑜伽咒语可以增强和同步固有的心血管节律，因为它将呼吸减慢到几乎每分钟 6 次呼吸，这与内源性循环节律。”
- This rhythm is no longer a secret. Type “breathing exercise” into Google, and a cute little breathing app will pop up to give you a minute of calm. Nestor doesn’t work for Google, but he cites the app in his epilogue because it encapsulates a principle he discovered through his research: “The perfect breath is this: Breathe in for about 5.5 seconds, then exhale for 5.5 seconds. That’s 5.5 breaths a minute for a total of about 5.5 liters of air.”
  这种节奏不再是秘密。在谷歌里敲“breathing exercise”，会弹出一个可爱的小呼吸应用程序，让你冷静一分钟。 Nestor 不在 Google 工作，但他在结语中引用了该应用程序，因为它概括了他通过研究发现的一个原则：“完美的呼吸是这样的：吸气约 5.5 秒，然后呼气 5.5 秒。那是每分钟呼吸 5.5 次，总共约 5.5 升空气。”
- “Breathing, it’s so easy, you don't need to buy a bunch of equipment to do it, you can just train yourself to breathe in a healthier way.” —James Nestor
  “呼吸，就是这么简单，不需要买一堆器械就能做到，只要训练自己更健康地呼吸就行了。” ——詹姆斯·内斯特
- Nestor, in his current pandemic mode, is a bearded, long-haired Californian surfer, but he’s no mystic. “The more people become aware of how disordered their breathing is throughout the day, the more they can fix it,” he explains pragmatically. “Breathing, it’s so easy, you don’t need to buy a bunch of equipment to do it, you can just train yourself to breathe in a healthier way.” Nestor’s book offers an exhaustive appendix of breathing methods he has personally researched and referenced, and his website features a collection of a dozen instructional videos by Harvard doctors, yogis, and other practitioners around the world. 
  内斯特目前处于流行病模式，是一名留着胡子、留着长发的加利福尼亚冲浪者，但他并不神秘。他务实地解释说：“人们越是意识到他们一整天的呼吸紊乱有多么严重，他们就越能解决这个问题。” “呼吸，就是这么简单，不需要买一堆器械就能做到，只要训练自己更健康的呼吸就可以了。”内斯特的书提供了他个人研究和参考的呼吸方法的详尽附录，他的网站收集了由哈佛医生、瑜伽士和世界各地的其他从业者制作的十几个教学视频。
- There are, indeed, a dizzying number of techniques to try. Conveniently, many of the most popular methods are available through free apps for your phone or computer, which make it very easy to work these exercises into your day. Nestor has a favorite app he’s been using for a long time even though the UX isn’t great. “I place it right on my desk and it has this very light tone with very slight hints when you should be inhaling and when you should be exhaling. Simply breathing this way is going to cause this physiological change in your body,” he says, “and really allow you to focus more. Whenever I have a really intense writing task, that’s exactly what I do.”
  确实，有许多令人眼花缭乱的技术可以尝试。方便的是，许多最流行的方法都可以通过手机或计算机的免费应用程序获得，这使得在您的一天中很容易地进行这些练习。 Nestor 有一个他最喜欢的应用程序，尽管用户体验不是很好，但他已经使用了很长时间。 “我把它放在我的桌子上，它的色调非常轻，并带有非常轻微的提示，什么时候应该吸气，什么时候应该呼气。简单地以这种方式呼吸会导致身体发生这种生理变化，”他说，“并且真正让你更加专注。每当我有一个非常紧张的写作任务时，这正是我所做的。”
## Don’t forget to breathe不要忘记呼吸
- There are many everyday situations in which holding your breath is very detrimental to your health and well being. Apnea is the medical term for the temporary cessation of breath, and sleep apnea is a major cause of high blood pressure and other heart ailments, as well as diabetes and depression. 
  在日常生活中，在许多情况下，屏住呼吸对您的健康和幸福是非常有害的。呼吸暂停是暂时停止呼吸的医学术语，睡眠呼吸暂停是导致高血压和其他心脏病以及糖尿病和抑郁症的主要原因。
- More directly relevant to our working lives is what writer Linda Stone calls email apnea, “a temporary absence or suspension of breathing, or shallow breathing, while doing email.” Both Stone and Nestor consulted with Dr. Margaret Chesney of UCSF, who’s been researching stress for forty years. Chesney demonstrated in a paper from 2002 the connection between perceived stress and diminished resting breathing rate, resulting from breath holding, and showed the effect is stronger in women than in men.
  与我们的工作生活更直接相关的是作家琳达·斯通 (Linda Stone) 所说的电子邮件呼吸暂停，“在收发电子邮件时，呼吸暂时消失或暂停，或呼吸变浅。”斯通和内斯特都咨询了加州大学旧金山分校的玛格丽特·切斯尼博士，她研究压力已有四十年。切斯尼在 2002 年的一篇论文中证明了感知压力与由于屏气而导致的静息呼吸频率降低之间的联系，并表明女性的影响比男性强。
- Stone related this interruption of breathing to a phenomenon that digitally-mediated work has made familiar to many of us, what she calls continuous partial attention. Simple multitasking involves sharing our attention between an undemanding background task and a more demanding foreground task, like eating lunch at your desk while replying to email. With continuous partial attention we’re constantly switching between many cognitively demanding activities: The now daily experience of being on a Zoom call while simultaneously monitoring a Slack channel and our email inboxes.
  斯通将这种呼吸中断与我们许多人都熟悉的数字媒体工作现象联系起来，她称之为持续局部注意力。简单的多任务处理涉及在要求不高的后台任务和要求更高的前台任务之间分享我们的注意力，例如在回复电子邮件的同时在办公桌前吃午饭。随着持续的部分注意力，我们不断在许多认知要求高的活动之间切换：现在每天都在进行 Zoom 通话，同时监控 Slack 频道和我们的电子邮件收件箱。
- “A large percentage of the population now, they’re half awake when they're trying to sleep and they’re half asleep when they’re trying to be awake and work,” says Nestor. “We’ve gotten so accustomed to this constant low-grade stress.”
  内斯特说：“现在，很大一部分人在试图入睡时处于半醒状态，而在试图保持清醒和工作时则处于半睡状态。” “我们已经习惯了这种持续的低级压力。”
- Reduced heart rate variability may be one of the underlying causes of sustained distractibility at work and may explain the connection between fitness and focus. A 2019 meta-analysis of relevant research concluded that “slow breathing techniques enhance autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility,” including increased heart rate variability. A 2016 University of Wisconsin-Madison study showed that short term awareness of breath reduced “the negative attentional effects associated with heavy media multitasking.” As is often the case, we can enlist one technology to help us manage another.
  心率变异性降低可能是工作中持续分心的根本原因之一，并且可以解释健康与注意力之间的联系。 2019 年对相关研究的荟萃分析得出结论，“缓慢呼吸技术可增强自主神经、大脑和心理的灵活性”，包括增加心率变异性。威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校 2016 年的一项研究表明，短期呼吸意识减少了“与繁重的媒体多任务处理相关的负面注意力影响”。通常情况下，我们可以利用一种技术来帮助我们管理另一种技术。
## Hold your breath, but on purpose屏住呼吸，但有意为之
- Holding your breath, of course, is not all bad. Many advanced breathing techniques do involve breath holding, but in a controlled and intentional way. What these techniques have in common with other forms of fitness training, Nestor says, is “acclimating your body to have a higher threshold of CO₂.”
  当然，屏住呼吸并不都是坏事。许多先进的呼吸技术确实涉及屏气，但是以一种可控和有意识的方式。 Nestor 说，这些技术与其他形式的健身训练的共同点是“让你的身体适应更高的二氧化碳阈值。”
- Because CO₂ is what triggers the impulse to take the next breath, building your tolerance for it enables you to decrease your respiration rate, and with it your resting heart rate. Talking about mountain climbers, Nestor says, “they train to breathe extremely slowly to tolerate more CO₂. And these people can summit high peaks without oxygen because breathing so much slower is so much more efficient.”
  因为二氧化碳会触发下一次呼吸的冲动，建立对它的耐受性可以让您降低呼吸频率，从而降低静息心率。谈到登山者，内斯特说，“他们训练呼吸极其缓慢，以承受更多的二氧化碳。这些人可以在没有氧气的情况下登顶高峰，因为呼吸慢得多效率高得多。”
- Nestor’s interest in breathing was a direct outgrowth of his previous book, Deep, that followed “clans of extreme athletes, adventurers, and scientists as they plumb the limits of the ocean's depths.” He had been sent on assignment for Outside magazine to cover a freediving competition in Greece. “After hanging out with these people for months and months, and seeing how they had trained their bodies to hold their breath for five, six, seven, eight minutes at a time, and dive to these incredible depths,” he says. “I thought if I was going to write about this stuff, I had to experience it myself.”  
  Nestor 对呼吸的兴趣是他前一本书 Deep 的直接产物，该书跟随“极限运动员、冒险家和科学家的部落探索海洋深度的极限”。他被派往《Outside》杂志采访在希腊举行的自由潜水比赛。 “在与这些人一起待了几个月又几个月之后，看到他们如何训练自己的身体一次屏住呼吸五、六、七、八分钟，然后潜入这些令人难以置信的深度，”他说。 “我想如果我要写这些东西，我必须自己去体验。”
- And so he did. “The first thing I learned from freedivers is do not pay attention to the watch. Do not pay attention to your depth. Every day your body changes,” he recounts. “You stay underwater as long as you feel comfortable. When you want to breathe, you come back up. It is never a competition.” He makes an important point that’s relevant to our relationship to technology of all kinds, “The point of freediving is to listen to yourself, not to listen to your devices.”
  他也这样做了。 “我从自由潜水员身上学到的第一件事就是不要注意手表。不要注意你的深度。你的身体每天都在变化，”他回忆道。 “只要你觉得舒服，你就呆在水下。当你想呼吸时，你会回来。这从来都不是比赛。”他提出了一个与我们与各种技术的关系相关的重要观点，“自由潜水的重点是倾听你自己，而不是倾听你的设备。”
- What got him hooked was not the competition and camaraderie of the divers, but the sense of peace and complete absorption they were able to experience in the ocean. He put his training to good use two years after that initial assignment, when he was invited to join a group of freedivers filming a 3-D documentary about sperm whales. “Once you dive with a whale and swim face to face with this animal, that door opens and it never really closes,” he says. 
  让他着迷的不是潜水员的竞争和友情，而是他们在海洋中能够体验到的平静和完全的沉浸感。在最初的任务两年后，当他被邀请加入一群自由潜水员拍摄一部关于抹香鲸的 3D 纪录片时，他充分利用了他的训练。 “一旦你和鲸鱼一起潜水并与这种动物面对面游泳，那扇门就会打开，而且永远不会真正关闭，”他说。
