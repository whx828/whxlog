## 浮墨笔记

1. 三个心理障碍
	1. I just don't think I can do this.
The next time you feel like you've fallen short, tell yourself: “This is putting me one tiny step closer to my goal.”
	2. People like me aren't good at this.
[Find people like you](https://ideas.ted.com/feel-like-you-dont-fit-in-heres-how-to-find-where-you-truly-belong/) doing things like this, and share your concerns with them.
    3. I feel like I have to do this thing, but I don't really want to do it.
Think of your intrinsic reason — the motivation behind why you're doing what you say you want to do — as your own personal energy source.
2. 真的想做，就开口求助。大部分人是愿意帮忙的。
3. 要反反复复地做。反反复复的另一个收获是更敏锐的感受。
4. 关注细微处的分别。
5. 喜欢吃的人多，喜欢做的人越来越少了。
6. The resulting correlation between walking speed and population was strikingly linear. With only a couple exceptions, people in places like Brooklyn, New York (pop: 2.6 million), walked faster than those in places like Psychro, Greece (pop: 365). The analysis indicated not only that life moves faster in the city than in the countryside, but that "pace of life varies in a regular fashion with the size of the local population, regardless of the cultural setting."
7. Pessimists sound smart. Optimists make money.
