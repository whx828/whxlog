## Types of Advertisement Strategies [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/NEY76wjBqPz#Types-of-Advertisement-Strategies)

Now-a-days even advertisement can be done in many ways. Like for example,
现在，甚至可以通过多种方式进行广告。例如，

### Ad Space [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/NEY76wjBqPz#Ad-Space)

In this approach, you allow an advertising company to use a particular section on your website to display their ads. This approach is rarely used anymore as the advertisers have to pay a constant amount of money no matter how many clicks and views the publisher's site is able to generate.
在这种方法中，您允许广告公司使用您网站上的特定部分来展示他们的广告。这种方法很少使用了，因为无论发布商的网站能够产生多少点击和浏览量，广告商都必须支付固定金额。

### Pay-Per-Click Advertising [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/NEY76wjBqPz#Pay-Per-Click-Advertising)

This modern approach is by far the most popular approach as it benefits the publisher and the advertiser equally. In this approach, the advertiser is only obliged to pay you when a visitor clicks through their ad. Every time a visitor clicks on the ad, a small deposit will be made in the publisher's account from advertising company.
这种现代方法是迄今为止最受欢迎的方法，因为它对出版商和广告商同样有利。在这种方法中，广告商只有在访客点击他们的广告时才有义务向你付款。每次有访客点击广告，广告公司就会在出版商的账户中存入一笔小额存款。

### Popups [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/NEY76wjBqPz#Popups)

No matter how much people dislike them, they are still a good source to make money online. The popup ads can be made less annoying if we design them professionally, for example, don't disappear the close button to annoy the users, then the popups can get us a lot of conversions!
无论人们多么不喜欢它们，它们仍然是网上赚钱的一个好来源。如果我们对弹出式广告进行专业的设计，例如不要让关闭按钮消失来烦扰用户，那么弹出式广告就能为我们带来大量的转化率!

### Affiliate Advertising [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/NEY76wjBqPz#Affiliate-Advertising)

If you have a huge traffic on your website, then you can affiliate products of other brand on your website. A user might get attracted to it and make a purchase, if he does, you will get a certain percentage of the profit the other brand will make. This is what we call “Affiliate Marketing”.
如果你的网站有巨大的流量，那么你可以在你的网站上加入其他品牌的产品。一个用户可能会被它吸引并购买，如果他这样做，你将获得其他品牌的一定比例的利润。这就是我们所说的 "联盟营销"。

### Publish Paid Reviews [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/NEY76wjBqPz#Publish-Paid-Reviews)

This approach is similar to affiliate advertising, but instead of promoting it directly on your website, you write paid reviews about the product and get paid accordingly. The price of the review depends on the traffic that your website gets.
这种方法类似于联盟广告，但不是直接在你的网站上推广，而是写关于产品的付费评论并获得相应的报酬。评论的价格取决于你的网站获得的流量。

## Payment Models [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/NEY76wjBqPz#Payment-Models)

As discussed above, Pay-Per-Click (PPC), also called Cost Per Click (CPC), follows a payment model in which publisher only gets paid when a click is made on the ad. In addition to this model, there are two other models that needs to be discussed here:
如上所述，每次点击付费（PPC），也称为每次点击成本（CPC），遵循一种支付模式，即只有在广告被点击时，出版商才会获得报酬。除了这种模式外，还有另外两种模式需要在此讨论。

- **CPM**: This is the oldest model used in the world of marketing and advertisement. In this model, you can paid for every 1000 views on the ad, no clicks needed this time. Only large websites with very heavy traffic can earn some decent amount of money through this model.
CPM。这是在营销和广告界使用的最古老的模式。在这种模式下，你可以为广告的每 1000 次浏览付费，这时不需要点击次数。只有那些流量非常大的大型网站才能通过这种模式赚到一些体面的钱。
- **CPA**: Stands for Cost-Per-Action. This model is similar to “Affiliate Marketing”. “Action” can be referred as a “purchase” or “lead”, so the ad publisher only gets paid when a lead is made.
CPA。代表每项行动的成本。这种模式类似于 "联盟营销"。"行动 "可以被称为 "购买 "或 "线索"，所以广告发布者只有在取得线索时才能获得报酬。

Now to make the payment process easier and to manage what ads should appear on your website, you will need to use a platform. There are hundreds of platforms available online but the most popular and reliable one is Google Adsense!
现在，为了使支付过程更容易，并管理哪些广告应该出现在你的网站上，你将需要使用一个平台。网上有数以百计的平台，但最受欢迎和最可靠的是 Google Adsense!

## What is Google Adsense? [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/NEY76wjBqPz#What-is-Google-Adsense?)

This is a platform offered by Google that helps manage the revenue between publishers, Google given by the advertisement company. Currently, Google has million of advertisers who want the traffic to their site. These advertisers pay on per-click bases. Google gets these ads from another platform called Adwords and then helps the publisher display them on the website. As a return it keeps a small percentage of the revenue given in exchange by the advertisement company.
这是谷歌提供的一个平台，帮助管理出版商之间的收入，谷歌由广告公司提供。目前，谷歌有数百万广告商希望获得他们网站的流量。这些广告商按点击次数付费。 Google 从另一个名为 Adwords 的平台获取这些广告，然后帮助发布商在网站上展示它们。作为回报，它保留了广告公司作为交换提供的收入的一小部分。
