## What is Web Analytics? [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#What-is-Web-Analytics?)

At this point, your website is fully-functionally running online. But you have no clue that who is visiting your website, how many people visit your website daily or monthly, what they did on your website, how they got here. This could be a very risky situation for the future of your website and can cause serious troubles if you make any future plans without considering these metrics! These metrics are basically termed as “Web Analytics”.
此时，您的网站功能齐全地在线运行。但是您不知道谁在访问您的网站，每天或每月有多少人访问您的网站，他们在您的网站上做了什么，他们是如何到达这里的。这对您网站的未来来说可能是一个非常危险的情况，如果您在不考虑这些指标的情况下制定任何未来计划，可能会导致严重的麻烦！这些指标基本上被称为“网络分析”。

_Web Analytics_ are the insights to your website that are tracked, recorded, reported and then analyzed in order to understand and optimize the performance of your website. You need to know if you're doing everything right on your website and figure out what extra steps you need to take in order to grow your business. Web analytics help you gain an insight of such findings.
网站分析是对您网站的洞察，经过跟踪、记录、报告和分析，以了解和优化您网站的性能。您需要知道自己是否在网站上做的一切都正确，并弄清楚需要采取哪些额外的步骤来发展您的业务。网络分析可帮助您深入了解此类发现。

Some of the most common metrics that can be monitored through any web analytics tools are:
可以通过任何网络分析工具监控的一些最常见的指标是：

### 1. Traffic [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#1.-Traffic)

The number of new and returning visitors to your website. Plus the number of sessions and views of your website also come under traffic.
您网站的新访问者和回访者的数量。此外，您网站的会话数和浏览量也会受到流量的影响。

### 2. Conversions [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#2.-Conversions)

Conversion means that a user has successfully signed up on your website and is performing an action that is basically the goal of your website. For example, purchasing something or downloading the content etc. You need to track the conversion rate of your website in order to find out how many users find your website useful and how many users just visit it and then abandon it without doing anything.
转换意味着用户已成功注册您的网站，并且正在执行基本上是您网站目标的操作。例如，购买东西或下载内容等。您需要跟踪您网站的转化率，以了解有多少用户认为您的网站有用，以及有多少用户只是访问了它，然后什么也不做就放弃了。

### 3. Session Time [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#3.-Session-Time)

Sessions are maintained for the returning users which are always considered a positive sign. You also need to log how much time the users spend on your website. The longer time they spend, the more their is a chance of conversion! If the user is not spending much time on your website then there is clearly a problem with your website. It is observed that if the website is user friendly and easy to navigate then the user is more likely to stay longer.
为返回的用户保留会话，这总是被认为是一个积极的迹象。你还需要记录用户在你的网站上花了多少时间。他们花费的时间越长，转换的机会就越大。如果用户在你的网站上花费的时间不多，那么你的网站显然有问题。据观察，如果网站对用户友好，易于浏览，那么用户就更有可能停留更长时间。

### 4. Bounce Rates [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#4.-Bounce-Rates)

On the other hand, if the users leave the site immediately (bounces) then you need to log this too and find out what web page causes the most bounces!
另一方面，如果用户立即离开网站（跳出），那么你也需要记录这一点，并找出哪个网页导致了最多的跳出!

### 5. Traffic Sources [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#5.-Traffic-Sources)

Tracking the number of visits to your site is not enough. You also need to analyze how the audience is getting to your website. Through an ad? Through Google or some social media website? You need to determine that which traffic sources users come from the most so you can make better marketing strategies.
跟踪对您网站的访问次数是不够的。您还需要分析受众如何访问您的网站。通过广告？通过谷歌或一些社交媒体网站？您需要确定用户来自哪些流量来源，以便制定更好的营销策略。

Google Analytics is a tool that groups all these visitors into multiple categories based on their traffic source. Here the different terms that Google Analytics uses as categories:
Google Analytics 是一种工具，可根据访问者的流量来源将所有这些访问者分为多个类别。以下是 Google Analytics 用作类别的不同术语：

- **Organic**: Traffic that visits by typing a relevant keyword on search engine.
有机流量：通过在搜索引擎上输入相关关键词访问的流量。

- **Paid Traffic**: Traffic that generates due to ads etc.
付费流量：由于广告等而产生的流量。

- **Email Marketing**: Traffic that visits due to email campaigns.
电子邮件营销：由于电子邮件活动而访问的流量。

- **Direct Traffic**: The traffic that enters the URL of your website directly to their browsers.
直接流量：直接进入你的网站的 URL 到他们的浏览器的流量。

- **Social Media**: Traffic that visits due your website through social ads or your social media accounts.
社会媒体：通过社会广告或你的社会媒体账户访问你的网站的流量。

- **Referrals**: The traffic that visits due to backlinks
推荐人：由于反向链接而访问的流量

### 6. ROI [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#6.-ROI)

This is the most critical factor of all! ROI means Return over Investment. If you are spending more as an investment than you are actually receiving as profit then it's definitely not a good strategy. By taking into account all of the other metrics you can eventually learn how to get this ROI measure in positive figures.
这是所有因素中最关键的一个! ROI 是指投资回报率。如果你作为投资的花费超过了你实际获得的利润，那么这绝对不是一个好的策略。通过考虑所有其他的指标，你最终可以学会如何让这个投资回报率的衡量标准变成正数。

## Steps in Web Analytics Process [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#Steps-in-Web-Analytics-Process)

The web analytics process follows a simple list of steps in order to gather the data and extract useful insights out of it. Given below are the six steps that we perform in the web analytics process:
网络分析过程遵循一个简单的步骤列表，以收集数据并从中提取有用的见解。以下是我们在网络分析过程中执行的六个步骤：

### Set Goals & Objectives: [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#Set-Goals-&-Objectives:)

You need to set some realistic goals that you want to meet by a certain period of time. The goals are different and unique for each website. For example, for your website, it could be to increase the conversion rate.
您需要设定一些您希望在特定时间段内实现的现实目标。每个网站的目标都是不同且独特的。例如，对于您的网站，可能是为了提高转化率。

### Building KPI’s [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#Building-KPI%E2%80%99s)

KPI stands the Key Performance Indicators. Web analytics provides a lot of statics but the ones that matter the most to a company and are crucial to meet the goals are named as KPI. They also vary from company to company based on their business goals. For example, in order to increase the conversion rate, you need to examine the factors that make the visitors abandon your website without going any further.
KPI 代表关键绩效指标。 Web 分析提供了许多静态数据，但对公司最重要且对实现目标至关重要的静态数据称为 KPI。他们也因公司的业务目标而异。例如，为了提高转化率，您需要检查使访问者放弃您的网站而不再进一步的因素。

### Collecting the Data [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#Collecting-the-Data)

Several techniques and tools are used to collect data from a website based on what exactly you want to capture. For example, if you want to capture the number of signups, you can use platforms like Google Analytics etc.
多种技术和工具可用于根据您想要捕获的确切内容从网站收集数据。例如，如果您想捕获注册数量，您可以使用 Google Analytics 等平台。

### Analyzing the Data [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#Analyzing-the-Data)

Now that you have collected the data, its time to analyze it and convert it to insights. This is the most important part of the process as all the future decisions are based on the results given in this step.
现在您已经收集了数据，是时候分析它并将其转化为洞察力了。这是流程中最重要的部分，因为所有未来的决策都基于此步骤中给出的结果。

### Testing Alternatives: [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#Testing-Alternatives:)

Website testing could be performed using an alternate tool or a different approach or on different set of web pages. Testing should be done in segments in order to understand the difference in behaviors and you also need to keep in mind that increase in one metric could make a negative impact on another metric.
可以使用替代工具或不同的方法或在不同的网页集上执行网站测试。测试应该分段进行，以了解行为的差异，您还需要记住，一个指标的增加可能会对另一个指标产生负面影响。

### Implementation [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/JY7MQYRozMl#Implementation)

This step implements the decisions that are made based on the insights gain in step 4. This could be a longterm or a short-term process, based on the kind of implementation you are going for. For example, to increase conversions on your website your team decides to add more options like “Download content”, “Learn More” and “Request a Quote”, etc. to increase interactivity!
这一步是实施根据第四步中获得的洞察力而做出的决定。这可能是一个长期的或短期的过程，基于你要实施的种类。例如，为了提高你网站的转换率，你的团队决定增加更多的选项，如 "下载内容"、"了解更多 "和 "请求报价" 等，以增加互动性。
