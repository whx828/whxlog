Now, we'll discuss some of the features that make a particular web hosting service suitable for us.
现在，我们将讨论一些使某个虚拟主机服务适合我们的特点。

In the previous lesson, we defined the different types of web hosting services available today. But how do we decide which approach best fits our website?
在上一课中，我们定义了当今不同类型的虚拟主机服务。但我们如何决定哪种方式最适合我们的网站？

Furthermore, even if we've decided the type of hosting we need, we have to find a reliable service among hundreds that swarm the web hosting industry?
此外，即使我们已经决定了我们需要的托管类型，我们还得在蜂拥而至的数百个虚拟主机行业中找到一个可靠的服务？

With that in mind, here are some of the major factors we need to keep in mind when choosing a web hosting service.
考虑到这一点，以下是我们在选择网络托管服务时需要注意的一些主要因素。

## The Nature of Our Website [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#The-Nature-of-Our-Website)

In order to decide a web hosting plan, we need to understand the behavior and the size of our website. Let's discuss this for all the hosting options we have.
为了决定一个虚拟主机计划，我们需要了解我们网站的行为和规模。让我们来讨论一下我们所拥有的所有托管选项。

### Conventional Hosts [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Conventional-Hosts)

For a **small website** that does not currently generate a lot of traffic or revenue, a **shared hosting service** would prove beneficial. It would be cheap and we wouldn't need to worry about server failures in case of excessive traffic. The only downside is that the server may restrict you from running all the softwares you want.
对于一个目前没有产生大量流量或收入的小网站，共享主机服务将被证明是有益的。它将是便宜的，而且我们不需要担心在流量过大的情况下服务器会出现故障。唯一的缺点是，服务器可能限制你运行所有你想要的软件。

A **large business** should always opt for **dedicated hosting** as it is the most efficient. It will also provide us with the highest storage space. **Managed hosting** would be better because it will ensure better security than any other web hosting plan.
一个大型企业应该总是选择专用主机，因为它是最有效的。它也将为我们提供最高的存储空间。管理型主机会更好，因为它将确保比任何其他虚拟主机计划更好的安全性。

A **virtual private server** falls in the middle of the spectrum between shared and dedicated hosting. The higher degree of freedom and the moderate cost makes it ideal for **medium sized and rapidly growing websites**.
虚拟私人服务器属于共享和专用托管之间的中间地带。较高的自由度和适度的成本使其成为中等规模和快速增长的网站的理想选择。

### Cloud Hosting [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Cloud-Hosting)

Moving to the cloud can be very beneficial for larger or growing businesses. It is much easier to scale our resources on the cloud. Educative itself uses the **Google Cloud Platform**. We highly recommend opting for a cloud host if one can afford it.
迁移到云端对于大型或成长中的企业来说是非常有益的。在云上扩展我们的资源要容易得多。Educative 本身使用谷歌云平台。如果有能力的话，我们强烈建议选择云主机。

## Reliability and Uptime Rates [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Reliability-and-Uptime-Rates)

A good web host is one which is always running, making your site available to anyone at any time. We should steer clear of a server that shuts down frequently and has an unsatisfactory uptime rate. The more popular services like [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) or [InMotion](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/) have uptime rates higher than **99.9%**, which makes them extremely reliable.
一个好的虚拟主机是一个始终在运行的主机，使你的网站在任何时候都能被任何人使用。我们应该避开经常关闭和正常运行时间率不理想的服务器。像 Bluehost 或 InMotion 这样比较流行的服务，其正常运行时间率高于 99.9%，这使得它们非常可靠。

With the introduction of cloud hosting, the risk of downtime is minimized since there is a whole cloud of servers which can replace each other in case one fails.
随着云主机的引入，停机的风险降到了最低，因为有一整片云的服务器，在其中一个出现故障时可以相互替换。

## Bandwidth [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Bandwidth)

Data transfer speed is one of the most important aspects of running a smooth website. In a situation where a lot of traffic is trying to access our website, the hosting service needs to provide us with a high bandwidth so that the users' experience is not hampered.
数据传输速度是运行一个顺利的网站最重要的方面之一。在大量流量试图访问我们的网站的情况下，托管服务需要为我们提供高带宽，以便用户的体验不会受到阻碍。

Dedicated servers and VPSs solve this problem better than shared servers. Cloud services provide very high bandwidth, with the option of acquiring more if needed.
专用主机和 VPS 比共享主机更能解决这个问题。云服务提供非常高的带宽，如果需要，可以选择获得更多的带宽。

## Security and Maintenance [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Security-and-Maintenance)

A web hosting service needs to have security measures in place to fight against cyber attacks. In case a server is physically damaged, our site needs to be stored on backup servers.
一个虚拟主机服务需要有安全措施来对抗网络攻击。万一服务器受到物理损坏，我们的网站需要存储在备份服务器上。

The company also needs to provide good tech support to its customers in case of any emergencies.
公司还需要在任何紧急情况下为其客户提供良好的技术支持。

## Necessary Utilities [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Necessary-Utilities)

The host we choose must make the following tools accessible to us:
我们选择的主机必须能让我们使用以下工具：

- PHP, Perl, JavaScript (web development languages)
PHP, Perl, JavaScript (网络开发语言)

- File Transfer Protocol (file accessibility)
文件传输协议（文件可访问性）

- .htaccess (Apache server configuration)
.htaccess (Apache 服务器配置)

- Server Side Includes
服务器端包括

- MySQL or MongoDB (database management)
MySQL 或 MongoDB (数据库管理)

- SSH (remote server communication)
SSH (远程服务器通信)

- Cron (job scheduler)
Cron (工作调度器)


## Control Panel [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Control-Panel)

Every decent web host provides us with a control panel from which we can manage our account. Here, we can change our account settings and view information about our website. Popular panels like **cPanel** or the **AWS management console** offer many more features.
每一个体面的虚拟主机都为我们提供一个控制面板，我们可以通过它来管理我们的账户。在这里，我们可以改变我们的账户设置，并查看有关我们网站的信息。cPanel 或 AWS 管理控制台等流行面板提供了更多功能。

## Good Reviews [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Good-Reviews)

In this age, the web hosting industry has become extremely saturated. As a result, it can be hard to guess the reliability of a company. Customer reviews can tell us about the quality of the service.
在这个时代，虚拟主机行业已经变得极为饱和。因此，要猜测一家公司的可靠性是很难的。客户评论可以告诉我们服务的质量。

## Domain Emails [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Domain-Emails)

We should be able to create email addresses for our domains and define their purposes (auto-response, admin accounts, etc.).
我们应该能够为我们的域名创建电子邮件地址，并定义其用途（自动回复、管理账户等）。

## Domain Name Purchasing [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Domain-Name-Purchasing)

Even though we've learned how to buy a domain independently, good web hosting services also offer the option of buying domains and sub-domains.
尽管我们已经学会了如何独立购买域名，但好的虚拟主机服务也提供购买域名和子域名的选择。

## Pricing [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Pricing)

We should always compare the prices of different hosts. Signup prices are very cheap but don't be fooled. In almost every case, subscription renewal prices are significantly higher than the initial cost.
我们应该经常比较不同主机的价格。注册价格非常便宜，但不要被愚弄。几乎在每一种情况下，续订价格都明显高于初始成本。

## Free Hosts vs. Paid Hosts [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#Free-Hosts-vs.-Paid-Hosts)

We can find both types on the market. Paid hosting services are much more reliable. Free hosting could be our last resort but it is a risky step to take in terms of safety and reliability. Furthermore, a free host will put up its own ads on our website to generate revenue.
我们可以在市场上找到这两种类型。付费的主机服务要可靠得多。免费主机可能是我们最后的手段，但就安全性和可靠性而言，它是一个冒险的步骤。此外，免费主机会在我们的网站上挂上自己的广告以产生收入。

## SSL Certificates [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/mEMz0KnQ7vp#SSL-Certificates)

It is an added bonus if the web hosting company allows us to order an SSL certificate. Simply put, SSL encrypts client-server communication on our web site, making transactions and file transfers much safer. We'll learn more about it in the [SSL Certificate](https://www.educative.io/collection/page/10370001/5654729883385856/5672180067074048) lesson.
如果虚拟主机公司允许我们订购 SSL 证书，这将是一个额外的好处。简单地说，SSL 对我们网站的客户端-服务器通信进行加密，使交易和文件传输更加安全。我们将在 SSL 证书一课中了解更多信息。

By considering all the factors listed above, we can have a fairly accurate idea about the hosting service we want to opt for. [HostingAdvice](https://www.hostingadvice.com/reviews/) has a very comprehensive list of companies ranked by user reviews.
通过考虑上面列出的所有因素，我们可以对我们想要选择的托管服务有一个相当准确的想法。HostingAdvice 有一个非常全面的按用户评论排名的公司名单。
