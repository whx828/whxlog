This section deals with the different methods of testing and maintenance which ensure the quality of our website. First up, we have server maintenance!
本节涉及不同的测试和维护方法，确保我们网站的质量。首先是服务器维护。

Now that our website is live, our task is to make sure that it runs smoothly. The server acts as a home for our product, so it only makes sense to keep our house clean. Not doing so may lead to grave situations. A server shutdown can cause major financial and informational losses, which is something we can't afford if our site generates heavy traffic.
现在，我们的网站已经上线，我们的任务是确保它顺利运行。服务器作为我们产品的家，保持我们的房子清洁是有意义的。不这样做可能会导致严重的情况。服务器关闭会造成重大的财务和信息损失，如果我们的网站产生大量的流量，这是我们无法承受的。

Whether we choose to appoint all maintenance jobs to a trusted **web/cloud host** or we do it ourselves, there are some fundamental practices we need to be aware of. Let's have a look at them now.
无论我们是选择将所有的维护工作委托给一个值得信赖的网络/云主机，还是我们自己来做，都有一些基本的做法需要注意。现在让我们来看看这些做法。

## Regular Updates [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/B8r3xAvn6oX#Regular-Updates)

We need to make sure that all our software is up to date because older versions are at the risk of losing technical support from their vendors.
我们需要确保我们所有的软件都是最新的，因为旧版本有失去供应商技术支持的风险。

In case of a web host, we should always have an updated control panel.
如果是虚拟主机，我们应该始终拥有更新的控制面板。

## Make Backups [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/B8r3xAvn6oX#Make-Backups)

Our application software and database should be regularly backed up. This will be useful in case of a server failure.
我们的应用软件和数据库应该定期备份。这在服务器发生故障时很有用。

## Monitor and Manage Disk Space [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/B8r3xAvn6oX#Monitor-and-Manage-Disk-Space)

A lot of creators do not pay attention to the obsolete data lurking in the recesses of their servers. While it may not be evident at first, the accumulating garbage information can take a toll on our server's performance.
很多创作者没有注意到潜伏在他们服务器深处的过时数据。虽然一开始可能并不明显，但累积的垃圾信息可能会对我们服务器的性能造成影响。

## Check for Hardware Problems [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/B8r3xAvn6oX#Check-for-Hardware-Problems)

We have to monitor hardware performance and take care of any abnormal behavior. Faulty components should be replaced or fixed as soon as possible.
我们必须监控硬件性能并处理任何异常行为。应尽快更换或修理有故障的部件。

## Security Measures [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/B8r3xAvn6oX#Security-Measures)

There should be security checks in place to resist cyber attacks. Vulnerability detecting softwares like [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-professional) and [Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/) are very suitable for this job.
应该有安全检查，以抵御网络攻击。像 Nessus 和 Qualys 这样的漏洞检测软件非常适用于这项工作。
