背景

This course is for anyone who wants to the learn the nitty gritty details and steps involved in making a website go live. Once you finish writing the code for your website, getting your server from local to live isn't that difficult. But since most of the tutorials don't cover this part so the developers are left to struggle with this last step alone. What makes this process tiring is that the programmers have to pick out a lot of stuff on their own as there is a huge variety of options available to go with.
本课程适用于任何想要了解使网站上线所涉及的细节和步骤的人。一旦你为你的网站写完代码，让你的服务器从本地运行起来就不是那么困难了。但是由于大多数教程都没有涵盖这一部分，因此开发人员只能在最后一步中挣扎。让这个过程很累的原因是程序员必须自己挑选很多东西，因为有各种各样的选择可供选择。

Most of the content available on the internet focuses only on covering the “steps” required to make the server live. They don't go into the basics of how things are working at the backend which confuses the developers even more. Most people end up learning these things on the fly and there is no concrete ‘manual’ for them.
互联网上可用的大多数内容仅侧重于介绍使服务器上线所需的“步骤”。他们没有深入了解后端的工作原理，这让开发人员更加困惑。大多数人最终都是在实践中学习这些东西，并且没有具体的“手册”供他们使用。
