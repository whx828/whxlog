In this section, we will learn about the different tools we need to make our website visible on the internet. Let's start by describing what web hosting is.
在本节中，我们将了解我们需要的不同工具，使我们的网站在互联网上可见。让我们首先介绍一下什么是虚拟主机。

At this point, we have picked the domain name for our website. However, our site still runs only on a local machine. To make it visible on the vast world of the internet, we need a **web hosting service**.
此时，我们已经为我们的网站选定了域名。然而，我们的网站仍然只在本地机器上运行。为了使它在广阔的互联网世界中可见，我们需要一个网络托管服务。

In a nutshell, a web hosting service stores your site on a _server_ and posts it online for public access. It acts as a platform which provides us the resources needed to run a website.
简而言之，虚拟主机服务将你的网站存储在服务器上，并将其发布到网上供公众访问。它作为一个平台，为我们提供运行一个网站所需的资源。

We can host a website by ourselves as well, but we'd need to have a powerful web server which can handle user traffic. A web hosting service solves this problem, along with many others. Selecting the appropriate service plays a crucial role in web deployment.
我们也可以自己主持一个网站，但我们需要有一个强大的网络服务器，可以处理用户流量。虚拟主机服务解决了这个问题，以及其他许多问题。选择适当的服务在网络部署中起着至关重要的作用。

## Types of Hosting [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/xV6PW0wYJGP#Types-of-Hosting)

Before we can pick a web host which suits our needs, we need to understand the primary web hosting strategies available to us in the market.
在我们挑选适合我们需求的虚拟主机之前，我们需要了解市场上可供我们选择的主要虚拟主机策略。

### Dedicated Servers [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/xV6PW0wYJGP#Dedicated-Servers)

A dedicated server will place all of its resources to host our website only. We never need to share the server's computing power with anyone else's website as it is dedicated to us. A dedicated server is also referred to as a **bare metal server** as it is a piece of machinery which serves only one tenant.
专用主机将把其所有的资源只用于托管我们的网站。我们从来不需要与其他人的网站分享服务器的计算能力，因为它是专门为我们服务的。专用主机也被称为裸机服务器，因为它是一块只为一个租户服务的机器。

This approach provides a high degree of freedom since we can customize the environment of the server as we see fit. Basically, a dedicated server is a server we own. We can even use it to manage multiple sites and softwares.
这种方法提供了高度的自由，因为我们可以根据自己的需要定制服务器的环境。基本上，专用服务器是一个我们自己的服务器。我们甚至可以用它来管理多个网站和软件。

The power of a dedicated server does not come without a cost. This is the most expensive type of web hosting with the monthly cost ranging roughly from $50 to $100. [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) and [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/) are popular dedicated hosting services.
专用主机的力量并不是没有代价的。这是最昂贵的虚拟主机类型，每月费用大致在 50 至 100 美元之间。Bluehost 和 HostGator 是流行的专用托管服务。

#### Managed Hosting [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/xV6PW0wYJGP#Managed-Hosting)

Managed hosting is a sub-category of dedicated web hosting where the service provider manages our server for us. This ensures better security measures and reduces the chance of server failure. We still have the freedom to do whatever we want with the server's resources. Usually, a service that provides dedicated hosting provides managed hosting as well. [LiquidWeb](https://www.liquidweb.com/) is a fairly reliable option when opting for managed hosting. However, it is a bit pricey.
托管主机是专用虚拟主机的一个子类别，服务提供商为我们管理服务器。这确保了更好的安全措施，减少了服务器故障的机会。我们仍然有自由对服务器的资源做任何事情。通常情况下，提供专用主机的服务也会提供托管主机。在选择托管主机时，LiquidWeb 是一个相当可靠的选择。然而，它的价格有点高。

### Virtual Private Servers (VPS) [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/xV6PW0wYJGP#Virtual-Private-Servers-(VPS) )

The VPS model acts as a toned down version of dedicated hosting. A server will run multiple **virtual servers**, each dedicated to one website. So even though our website will work on a shared host, we would have our private environment with all the flexibilities of a dedicated server.
VPS 模式作为专用主机的一个淡化版本。一台服务器将运行多个虚拟主机，每一个都专门用于一个网站。因此，即使我们的网站将在一个共享主机上工作，我们也将拥有我们的私人环境，并具有专用服务器的所有灵活性。

The performance wouldn't reach as high as that of a dedicated hosting environment, but the level of safety and reliability is higher than pure shared hosting.
性能不会达到专用主机环境的那么高，但安全和可靠性水平比纯共享主机高。

A typical VPS costs around $30 per month. Two of the most popular VPS services today are [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/) and [InMotion Hosting](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/) .
一个典型的 VPS 每月费用约为 30 美元。今天最流行的两个 VPS 服务是 Namecheap 和 InMotion Hosting。

### Shared Hosting [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/xV6PW0wYJGP#Shared-Hosting)

In shared hosting, a server will divide its resources between our site and many others. We are neither in control of the server, nor do we have any association with the other sites running on it.
在共享主机中，服务器会将其资源分配给我们的网站和其他许多网站。我们既不控制服务器，也不与服务器上运行的其他网站有任何联系。

![[Shared Hosting.png]]

Naturally, shared hosting is not as efficient as dedicated hosting since the server's power is distributed. Heavy traffic on one site could greatly effect the performance of ours. However, a very logical reason for choosing a shared server is the significant ease in cost.
自然，共享主机不如专用主机高效，因为服务器的功率是分布式的。一个站点上的大量流量可能会极大地影响我们的性能。但是，选择共享服务器的一个非常合乎逻辑的原因是成本显着降低。

You can find a shared host service for less than $10 per month. This makes shared servers more suitable for smaller sites with lesser data to store. [InMotion Hosting](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/) and [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) are reputable platforms for shared hosting.
您可以找到每月不到 10 美元的共享主机服务。这使得共享服务器更适合存储较少数据的小型站点。 InMotion Hosting 和 Bluehost 是著名的共享托管平台。

### Cloud Hosting [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/xV6PW0wYJGP#Cloud-Hosting)

This is the latest development in the world of website hosting. In cloud hosting, the resources for our website are spread across multiple virtual servers which are part of the _cloud_. We can acquire as many virtual cloud servers as we need, and we call also specify their technical power (RAM, storage, etc.).
这是网站托管领域的最新发展。在云主机中，我们网站的资源分布在多个虚拟服务器上，这些服务器是云的一部分。我们可以根据需要获得尽可能多的虚拟云服务器，我们还可以调用指定的技术力量（内存、存储等）。

![[Cloud Hosting.png]]

One of the biggest problems solved by cloud hosting is that we are finally free from the risk of a server shutdown. In case one server fails, the data load can be moved to any of the servers spanning the globe.
云主机解决的最大问题之一是，我们终于摆脱了服务器关闭的风险。如果一个服务器出现故障，数据负载可以转移到遍布全球的任何一个服务器上。

Bandwidth limitations have also been greatly reduced since our website's speed does not depend on a single server.
由于我们的网站速度不取决于单一的服务器，带宽限制也大大减少。

In terms of costing, we only have to pay for what we use. As we scale up or scale down (which has also been made very easy), our costs adjust automatically. That's really convenient! Due to such reasons, more and more people are opting for cloud hosting.
在成本计算方面，我们只需要为我们使用的东西付费。当我们扩大或缩小规模时（这也很容易），我们的费用会自动调整。这真的很方便! 由于这样的原因，越来越多的人选择了云主机。

Modern tech giants such as [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/) , [Google](https://cloud.google.com/) and [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) have become pioneers in this rapidly growing technology. Hence, there are very reliable services available to everyone.
现代科技巨头如亚马逊、谷歌和微软已经成为这一快速增长的技术的先驱。因此，有非常可靠的服务提供给大家。
