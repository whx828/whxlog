#### Pricing [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/gxkwp390mEj#Pricing)

Pricing is the most critical factor among all! You will come across a plenty of pricing options while searching for domain registrars. The prices are mostly charged at an annual rate or at the period of two, three or sometimes even more number of years.
价格是所有因素中最关键的因素! 在搜索域名注册商时，你会遇到大量的定价选项。价格大多是按年收费，或按两年、三年或有时甚至更多年的期限收费。

It is highly recommended that your do the purchasing on annual basis as it gives you the opportunity to switch to a another registrar if needed. You must also confirm if the registrar provides the auto-renewal option. When the domain expires after the completion of the period, there is a high possibility that someone else might purchase it. So it is highly recommended that you look for a registrar that reminds you to renew your domain registration. Also, make sure to read if they add any additional charges for reminders and renewal of the registration.
强烈建议你按年购买，因为它使你有机会在需要时切换到另一个注册商。你还必须确认该注册商是否提供自动续约选项。当域名到期后，很有可能会有其他人购买它。因此，强烈建议你寻找一个能提醒你更新域名注册的注册商。此外，请务必阅读他们是否为提醒和续期注册增加任何额外费用。

#### Customer Support [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/gxkwp390mEj#Customer-Support)

It is often the case that you end up with a registrar that is not too expensive but has a very poor customer support. In the long run, it causes a lot of trouble and eventually you have to shift to a better registrar. Always make sure that their customer support responses on time and are actually helpful so you can get in touch with them if something goes wrong on your website. To find that out, you can either read reviews online or drop them an email and see how quickly they respond.
通常情况下，您最终会遇到一个不太贵但客户支持非常差的注册商。从长远来看，它会带来很多麻烦，最终您必须转向更好的注册商。始终确保他们的客户支持及时响应并且实际上很有帮助，以便在您的网站出现问题时与他们取得联系。要找出答案，您可以在线阅读评论或给他们发送电子邮件，看看他们的回复速度有多快。

#### Additional Features [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/a-complete-guide-to-launching-your-website-from-local-to-live/gxkwp390mEj#Additional-Features)

A lot of registrars offer extra features in addition to just registering your domain. You must carefully consider the set of services that you might need in the future and see if the registrar provides those services. For example, do they hold onto your domain when the subscription expires? (Your competitors might purchase the domain name once the subscription expires and it goes available for sale, this concept is called Drop-Catching). Do they allow purchasing certificates for your website? Do they allow domain transferring? If yes, then look up for their transferring policy and any additional charges. Some registrars do it free of cost but require you to complete a certain period of time (60 days approximately). Can it also host your website? Does the registrar provides you privacy protection? It is suggested that you list down a few registrars and see which of them offer these extra features. It's always convenient to keep everything at one place so always look for a service which provides all these features.
很多注册商除了提供注册域名之外，还提供额外的功能。你必须仔细考虑你将来可能需要的一系列服务，看看注册商是否提供这些服务。例如，当订阅到期时，他们是否会保留你的域名？(你的竞争对手可能会购买域名，一旦订阅到期，它就可以出售，这个概念被称为 Drop-Catching）。他们是否允许为你的网站购买证书？他们允许域名转让吗？如果是的话，那么请查一下他们的转移政策和任何额外的费用。有些注册商是免费的，但要求你完成一定的时间（大约 60 天）。它是否也可以托管你的网站？该注册商是否为你提供隐私保护？建议你列出几个注册商，看看他们中哪些人提供这些额外的功能。把所有东西都放在一个地方总是很方便的，所以一定要寻找一个能提供所有这些功能的服务。
