Web Design is a very important part of the website. It requires a lot of creativity. The UI part of the website is not that difficult to design if you have a creative mind. However, the UX (user experience) requires the designer to have a lot of experience in order to design a high usability website. You need to be familiar with UI principles, like what color palette to use, which font size is easily readable for the eyes etc. in order to become a good designer.
网页设计是网站的一个非常重要的部分。它需要大量的创造力。如果您有创意，网站的 UI 部分设计起来并不难。然而，UX（用户体验）需要设计师有丰富的经验才能设计一个高可用性的网站。您需要熟悉 UI 原则，例如使用哪种调色板、哪种字体大小易于眼睛阅读等，才能成为一名优秀的设计师。
