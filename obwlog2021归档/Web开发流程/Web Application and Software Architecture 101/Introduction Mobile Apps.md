## The arrival of handheld devices [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-application-software-architecture-101/RMgLrRX8RlE#The-arrival-of-handheld-devices)
手持设备的到来

If I told you that today mobile devices have the maximum market penetration globally, you probably wouldn't be surprised. Approximately, _60_ to _70%_ of the users in this day and age are accessing online services through their mobile devices as opposed to accessing them via their laptops or desktops.
如果我告诉你，今天移动设备在全球拥有最大的市场渗透率，你可能不会感到惊讶。在这个时代，大约有 60% 到 70% 的用户是通过他们的移动设备访问在线服务，而不是通过笔记本电脑或台式机访问。

This technology shift is for a few reasons: _accessibility_ and the _ease of use_ of mobile devices. We can carry our mobile phones with us everywhere, be it when hanging out with our friends or when at our office cubicles. Also, we don't have to be tech-savvy to operate a handheld device. My mother, who has never operated a computer, runs Google searches through voice commands on her Android device, without any sort of assistance. This is how simple and intuitive the user interface of handheld devices is.
这种技术转变有几个原因：可及性和移动设备的易用性。我们可以随处携带我们的手机，不管是和朋友出去玩的时候还是在办公室的隔间里。另外，我们不一定要精通技术才能操作手持设备。我的母亲从来没有操作过电脑，她在她的安卓设备上通过语音命令运行谷歌搜索，没有任何形式的协助。这就是手持设备的用户界面是多么简单和直观。

Engineers have done an impeccable job making the user interfaces as intuitive as possible making the onboarding of the new users smooth. The mass adoption of handheld devices has totally changed the technology landscape. It has provided a way for non-tech-savvy users to enter into the online universe. It's a totally different ball game. Businesses are going from _web-first_ to _mobile-first_. There was a time when just nerds used to play computer games, but today everyone is playing _Candy Crush, PubG, and Fortnite_ on their mobile devices.
工程师们已经做了无懈可击的工作，使 UI 尽可能直观，使新用户顺利上岗。手持设备的大规模采用已经完全改变了技术格局。它为不懂技术的用户提供了一个进入网络世界的途径。这是一个完全不同的赛道。企业正在从网络优先转向移动优先。曾几何时，只有书呆子才会玩电脑游戏，但今天所有人都在移动设备上玩 Candy Crush、PubG 和 Fortnite。

## The transition from desktop to mobile [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-application-software-architecture-101/RMgLrRX8RlE#The-transition-from-desktop-to-mobile)
从桌面端到移动端的过渡

I've always been an avid gamer. I love to play games on all the platforms, be it the web, a console, or a desktop. Back in the day, around _2010_, I got introduced to casual gaming via Facebook social games like _Farmville_, and many more. These games have a freemium business model, these are free to play with in-game purchases and were popularized by companies like _Zynga_ in conjunction with social networks like _Facebook_. Farmville is one popular product of Zynga that had a major contribution in putting the company on _NASDAQ_.
我一直是一个狂热的游戏玩家。我喜欢在所有的平台上玩游戏，不管是网络、游戏机还是桌面。早在 2010 年左右，我就通过 Facebook 的社交游戏，如 Farmville 等，接触到了休闲游戏。这些游戏有一个免费的商业模式，这些游戏可以免费玩，但要在游戏中购买一些物品什么的，由 Zynga 等公司与 Facebook 等社交网络共同推广。Farmville 是 Zynga 的一个流行产品，对该公司在纳斯达克上市有重大贡献。

I got pretty hooked. These casual games became my thing. I often switched between my work tab and the game tab throughout the day on my laptop. This kind of kept me going for a longer period of time without getting bored or burnt out.
我完全被迷上了。这些休闲游戏成了我最重要的事。我经常在我的笔记本电脑上整天切换我的工作标签和游戏标签。这使我在较长的时间内不会感到厌烦或倦怠。

Online multiplayer social gaming was a new thing then, and it became a major source of earning for Facebook. Every now and then there was a new exciting game on the Facebook app store. [Just Zynga alone contributed to 15 to 20% of Facebook's total earnings.](https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/23/zynga-made-up-15-of-facebooks-revenue-in-q1-down-from-19-a-year-ago/)
当时，在线多人社交游戏是一个新事物，它成为 Facebook 的一个主要收入来源。每隔一段时间，Facebook 的应用商店就会出现一个新的令人兴奋的游戏。仅 Zynga 一家就贡献了 Facebook 总收入的 15% 至 20%。

Gradually, smartphones became popular. They significantly improved in hardware and they were loaded with more features, cool cameras, better memory, and whatnot. As smartphone's popularity rose, and they became a household thing, this changed the whole online gaming landscape. Almost all of the games transitioned to mobile devices, as the gaming companies observed _better user retention_ and _engagement rates_ via the mobile versions of their games. There were more Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Daily Active Users (DAU) after the gaming studios introduced mobile clients for their games.
渐渐地，智能手机开始流行。它们在硬件上有了明显的改进，它们装载了更多的功能，很酷的相机，更好的内存，以及其他一些东西。随着智能手机的普及，它们成为家喻户晓的东西，这改变了整个在线游戏的格局。几乎所有的游戏都过渡到了移动设备上，因为游戏公司通过其游戏的移动版本观察到了更好的用户保留和参与率。在游戏工作室为其游戏引入移动客户端后，月活跃用户（MAU）和日活跃用户（DAU）数量增加。

As mobile engagement was increasing, web engagement was decreasing. Many businesses decided to focus just on the mobile. _Clash of Clans_ is a good example of this.
随着移动参与度的增加，网络参与度在下降。许多企业决定只专注于移动领域。《部落冲突》就是一个很好的例子。

Today, you can hardly find any games on Facebook, besides the instant messenger games. Several have gone _mobile-only_. The Facebook game store feels like a deserted place, and the social network is focusing more on ads, business pages, and Facebook groups to make profits. This technology shift is not just for the gaming segment. This is happening for arguably every business niche.
今天，除了即时通讯工具游戏，你在 Facebook 上几乎找不到任何游戏。有几家已经只做了移动端。脸谱网的游戏商店给人的感觉就像一个荒废的地方，社交网络正更多地关注广告、商业页面和脸谱网小组，以赚取利润。这种技术转变不仅仅是针对游戏领域。可以说每一个商业细分领域都在发生这种情况。

Mobile devices today bring-in the majority of the traffic for businesses. There are _mobile-only_ businesses with billions of users like _Instagram, TikTok, Pokemon Go_, and so on. _Google Play Store_ has over 2 billion monthly active users and has over 3.5 million apps, 82 billion app downloads as of today.
今天，移动设备为企业带来了大部分的流量。有一些纯移动业务拥有数十亿用户，如 Instagram、TikTok、Pokemon Go 等。谷歌游戏商店有超过 20 亿月度活跃用户，并有超过 350 万个应用程序，截至目前有 820 亿次应用程序下载。

In case you are wondering what terms like _mobile-only, mobile-first, mobile-friendly_ really mean and how important they are in the application development universe, you'll find out in the next lesson.
如果你想知道纯移动、移动优先、移动友好等术语的真正含义，以及它们在应用开发领域的重要性，你将在下一课中找到答案。
