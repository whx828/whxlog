In this lesson, we will discuss what are the basic functionalities of back-end engineers.
在本课中，我们将讨论后端工程师的基本能力是什么。

## What do backend engineers do? [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/7DL2PLQVJ0r#What-do-backend-engineers-do?-)

Backend engineers program servers to process user requests and respond with the requested resource correctly. They also write code to process and store user data.
后端工程师对服务器进行编程，以处理用户请求，并正确响应所请求的资源。他们还编写代码来处理和存储用户数据。

### Efficient storage and delivery of information [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/7DL2PLQVJ0r#Efficient-storage-and-delivery-of-information-)

Data that pertains to a website has to be stored in a database and delivered upon request. Consider Amazon's database of items; if their database query system becomes inefficient at any point, they'll lose customers.
与网站有关的数据必须存储在数据库中，并根据要求交付。考虑一下亚马逊的物品数据库；如果他们的数据库查询系统在任何时候变得低效，他们就会失去客户。

### Customized user experience [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/7DL2PLQVJ0r#Customized-user-experience-)

Servers often store and use information about clients to provide a tailored user experience. For example, many sites store credit card details so that the information doesn't have to be entered again.
服务器通常存储和使用有关客户端的信息来提供量身定制的用户体验。例如，许多站点存储信用卡详细信息，因此不必再次输入信息。

### Controlled access to content [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/7DL2PLQVJ0r#Controlled-access-to-content-)

Backend programming entails restricting access to information appropriately. For example, in a ride-hailing application such as Uber, one user should not be able to view another's car travel history.
后端编程需要适当地限制对信息的访问。例如，在 Uber 这样的叫车应用中，一个用户不应该能够查看另一个用户的汽车旅行记录。

### Store session/state information [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/7DL2PLQVJ0r#Store-session/state-information-)

Backend engineers also do user session handling, i.e., a string is associated with each user that visits the website, and data associated with the string such as their emails or order history are saved and displayed when the user visits again. Another example is saving the state of a simple game so that the user can go to the site again and carry on from where they left it.
后端工程师还进行用户会话处理，即将访问该网站的每个用户关联一个字符串，并在用户再次访问时保存并显示与该字符串关联的数据，例如他们的电子邮件或订单历史记录。另一个例子是保存一个简单游戏的状态，以便用户可以再次访问该站点并从他们离开的地方继续。

### Notifications [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/7DL2PLQVJ0r#Notifications-)

Servers can be programmed to send general or user-specific notifications through the website itself or via email, SMS, instant messaging, video conversations, or other communications services.
服务器可以被编程为通过网站本身或通过电子邮件、短信、即时通信、视频对话或其他通信服务发送一般或特定用户的通知。

A few examples include:
一些例子包括：

- Facebook and Twitter send emails and SMS messages to notify you of new communications.
Facebook 和 Twitter 会发送电子邮件和 SMS 消息以通知您有新的通信。
- Amazon regularly sends product emails that suggest products similar to those already bought or viewed that you might be interested in.
亚马逊会定期发送产品电子邮件，推荐与您可能感兴趣的已购买或查看过的产品类似的产品。
- A web server might send warning messages to site administrators, alerting them to low memory on the server or suspicious user activity.
Web 服务器可能会向站点管理员发送警告消息，提醒他们服务器内存不足或用户活动可疑。

### Data analysis [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/7DL2PLQVJ0r#Data-analysis-)

A website may collect a lot of data about users: what they search for, what they buy, what they recommend, how long they stay on each page. Server-side programming can be used to refine responses based on an analysis of this data.
一个网站可能会收集很多关于用户的数据：他们搜索了什么、他们购买了什么、他们推荐了什么、他们在每个页面上停留的时间。服务器端编程可用于根据对此数据的分析来优化响应。

For example, Amazon and Google both advertise products based on previous searches (and purchases).
例如，亚马逊和谷歌都根据之前的搜索（和购买）为产品做广告。
