In this lesson, we're going to get an introduction to server-side programming in JavaScript.
在本课中，我们将介绍 JavaScript 中的服务器端编程。

## What is Node.js? [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/3jO9ZAKR084#What-is-Node.js?-)

The [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) says, “As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications. In the following “hello world” example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node will sleep.”
Node.js 官方网站说：“作为异步事件驱动的 JavaScript 运行时，Node 旨在构建可扩展的网络应用程序。在下面的“hello world”示例中，可以同时处理许多连接。每次连接时，都会触发回调，但如果没有工作要做，Node 将休眠。”

You're probably thinking, “…???”
你可能在想，“……？？？”

What they actually mean to say is that Node is a runtime environment that can run JavaScript outside of browsers. Also that servers written in Node can handle multiple connections at once, which makes them more efficient.
他们实际上想说的是，Node 是一个运行时环境，可以在浏览器之外运行 JavaScript。此外，用 Node 编写的服务器可以一次处理多个连接，这使它们更高效。

### Why Node? [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/3jO9ZAKR084#Why-Node?-)

Node is great for software prototyping i.e., building incomplete versions of something that demonstrate what it is meant to do eventually. Node is also incredibly fast and highly scalable, which means that it is great to use in the industry. Furthermore, it uses JavaScript, which is a language that most people are already familiar with, so writing in Node is easy. Also, the code written for Node is usually cleaner and more consistent. Lastly, there is a large ecosystem of open-source libraries available for Node.
Node 非常适用于软件原型开发，即建立一些不完整的版本，展示它最终要做的事情。Node 还具有令人难以置信的速度和高度可扩展性，这意味着它很适合在行业内使用。此外，它使用 JavaScript，这是一种大多数人已经熟悉的语言，所以用 Node 编写很容易。另外，为 Node 编写的代码通常更干净、更一致。最后，Node 有一个庞大的开源库的生态系统。
