We especially hope that you feel more rooted when it comes to the world of web development and that you understand the context in which it occurs a little better. Some of you might have felt that we stated the obvious in some parts of this course - and yes, that is true to some extent - but remember that what is obvious to you might not be to everyone. In the wise words of Nick Carraways's father:

## Quick Recap [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/7npJ94rDlgw#Quick-Recap-)

- The internet is just devices connected to each other. Some of these devices are web servers and web clients.
互联网只是相互连接的设备。其中一些设备是 Web 服务器和 Web 客户端。
- Web clients are devices that navigate and view websites. Web servers ‘host’ these websites, which means that they have the websites' code. Website code can be divided into two parts: front-end and back-end.
Web 客户端是导航和查看网站的设备。 Web 服务器“托管”这些网站，这意味着它们拥有网站的代码。网站代码可以分为前端和后端两部分。

- Front-end code consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Most modern websites never use these languages as they are (vanilla); they usually use front-end frameworks.
前端代码由 HTML、CSS 和 JavaScript 组成。大多数现代网站从不使用这些语言（原版）；他们通常使用前端框架。

- Frameworks make coding up the front-end a lot simpler because most low-level and common functionality is already implemented. The back-end consists of a server, server software, and a database.
框架使前端的编码变得更加简单，因为大多数低级和通用功能已经实现。后端由服务器、服务器软件和数据库组成。

- Databases store all your website's data that users can query through the functionality given at the front-end.
数据库存储您网站的所有数据，用户可以通过前端提供的功能查询这些数据。

- Someone who is proficient at both and front and back-end programming is called a full-stack developer.
精通前端和后端编程的人被称为全栈开发人员。

- Git is a version control system that you can use to keep track of changes that you make to your code. It can also help you collaborate and revert any changes you made if you encounter a bug later. This is great because you won't have to keep track of your project by naming files like this: ‘code-1.cpp’ ‘code-2.cpp’, ‘code-with-jeffs-changes.cpp’. This also keeps your directories clean and easy to manage.
Git 是一个版本控制系统，您可以使用它来跟踪对代码所做的更改。如果您以后遇到错误，它还可以帮助您进行协作并恢复您所做的任何更改。这很棒，因为您不必通过这样命名文件来跟踪您的项目：‘code-1.cpp’‘code-2.cpp’，‘code-with-jeffs-changes.cpp’。这也使您的目录保持干净且易于管理。

- Software development is an art, and there are many approaches to developing software, each of which is suited to different scenarios.
软件开发是一门艺术，开发软件的方法有很多种，每种方法都适用于不同的场景。
