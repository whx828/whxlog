An overview of back-end frameworks that are commonly used.
常用的后端框架概述。


The back-end, as we have already seen, refers to the server-side of a web application. The back-end spans everything from the initial creation of the server to the handling of user requests on the application. Let us take a look at the various back-end frameworks that exist to make these tasks much easier!
正如我们已经看到的，后端是指 Web 应用程序的服务器端。后端涵盖从最初创建服务器到处理应用程序上的用户请求的所有内容。让我们来看看现有的各种后端框架，使这些任务变得更加容易！

## Express (JavaScript) [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/3jQWBQgLAgn#Express-(JavaScript)-)

[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) often referred to as the “de facto standard server framework” for Node.js, is a minimal and highly flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web applications. The idea behind Express is to simplify the back-end development process enough to reduce basic back-end features such as creating an HTTP server from multiple, unintelligible lines of Node.js code, to a single instruction, while simultaneously keeping the core syntactical and logical characteristics of Node.js intact.
Express.js 通常被称为 Node.js 的 "事实上的标准服务器框架"，是一个最小和高度灵活的 Node.js 网络应用程序框架，为网络应用程序提供了一套强大的功能。Express 背后的理念是简化后端开发过程，足以将基本的后端功能（如从多行难以理解的 Node.js 代码中创建一个HTTP服务器）减少到一条指令，同时保持 Node.js 的核心句法和逻辑特征不变。

## Symfony (PHP) [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/3jQWBQgLAgn#Symfony-(PHP)-)

[Symfony](https://symfony.com/) is a web development framework for PHP. The key idea behind Symfony is that it is essentially a set of reusable components. The benefits of this are obvious; with over 30 standalone components at your disposal, the process of writing an application becomes considerably simplified and, consequently, much easier and more efficient. Symfony, like the previous frameworks we have discussed, allows for more compact, readable, and simple code. This is beneficial because it allows you to focus on the higher-level functionality you want to implement as the more mundane tasks become confined to much smaller pieces of code that do not need to be thought about from scratch.
Symfony 是 PHP 的 Web 开发框架。 Symfony 背后的关键思想是它本质上是一组可重用的组件。这样做的好处是显而易见的；有 30 多个独立组件可供您使用，编写应用程序的过程变得相当简单，因此更加容易和高效。 Symfony 和我们之前讨论过的框架一样，允许更紧凑、可读和简单的代码。这是有益的，因为它允许您专注于您想要实现的更高级别的功能，因为更平凡的任务被限制在不需要从头开始考虑的更小的代码片段中。

## Django (Python) [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/3jQWBQgLAgn#Django-(Python)-)

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python web framework that enables the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Django, like Express, takes care of reducing code for basic functionalities to simple instructions, so you can focus on writing your application and implementing more specific functionality without needing to reinvent the wheel and getting caught up in needlessly long bouts of code in doing so!
Django 是一个高级 Python Web 框架，可以快速开发安全且可维护的网站。与 Express 一样，Django 负责将基本功能的代码简化为简单指令，因此您可以专注于编写应用程序和实现更具体的功能，而无需重新发明轮子，也无需陷入不必要的冗长代码！

## Ruby on Rails (Ruby) [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/3jQWBQgLAgn#Ruby-on-Rails-(Ruby)-)

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), also known as Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby. Rails is built on the Model View Controller architecture that we have previously studied, and it provides default structures for everything that goes into each component, including databases, several common web services as well as web pages themselves. Ruby on Rails, therefore, separates the process of web development into simplified components and provides a basic structure for each element any given component comprises of, thus making it immensely convenient for users to build their own specific functionality on top of these provisional structures without having to worry about starting from the very basics.
Ruby on Rails，也被称为 Rails，是一个用 Ruby 编写的服务器端网络应用程序框架。Rails 建立在我们之前研究过的模型-视图-控制器（MVC）架构之上，它为每个组件中的所有东西提供了默认结构，包括数据库、几个常见的网络服务以及网页本身。因此，Ruby on Rails 将网络开发的过程分离成简化的组件，并为任何给定的组件所包含的每个元素提供了一个基本的结构，从而使用户在这些临时结构上建立自己的特定功能变得非常方便，而不必担心从最基本的东西开始。

## ASP .NET (C#) [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/3jQWBQgLAgn#ASP-.NET-(C#)-)

[ASP.NET](https://www.asp.net/) is an open-source, server-side web development framework for building modern web applications and services using .NET or any language supported by .NET. ASP .NET was developed by Microsoft to facilitate the process of developing dynamic web pages, and it has, therefore, considerably simplified the process of creating websites based on HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. As a result, it has made it possible for users to create websites that are not only simple and fast but also have the capacity to scale to millions of users.
ASP.NET 是一种开源的服务器端 Web 开发框架，用于使用 .NET 或 .NET 支持的任何语言构建现代 Web 应用程序和服务。 ASP .NET 是由 Microsoft 开发的，用于促进开发动态网页的过程，因此它大大简化了基于 HTML5、CSS 和 JavaScript 创建网站的过程。因此，它使用户可以创建不仅简单快速而且能够扩展到数百万用户的网站。

That covers the variety of both back-end and front-end frameworks you can choose from to build your first website. However, these aren't all the frameworks you can consider. In the next lesson, we will discuss the third type of framework you can choose from called isomorphic frameworks.
这涵盖了您可以选择构建第一个网站的各种后端和前端框架。但是，这些并不是您可以考虑的所有框架。在下一课中，我们将讨论您可以选择的第三种类型的框架，称为同构框架。
