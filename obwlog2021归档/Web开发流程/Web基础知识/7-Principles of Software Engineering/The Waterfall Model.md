An overview of the waterfall method of developing software.
开发软件的瀑布方法概述。

## Introduction [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/q26XMjGk480#Introduction-)

The waterfall model is the first published model of the software development process, and it consists of representing the fundamental activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution as separate, sequential process phases.
瀑布模型是第一个公布的软件开发过程模型，它包括将规范、开发、验证和进化等基本活动表示为独立的、连续的过程阶段。

## Principle stages [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/q26XMjGk480#Principle-stages)

There are multiple stages involved in the waterfall model, and theoretically, every stage must be completed before the next one can be “cascaded” on to, which is why the model is referred to as the waterfall model.
瀑布模型涉及多个阶段，理论上，每个阶段都必须完成才能“级联”到下一个阶段，这就是该模型被称为瀑布模型的原因。

Each of the five stages depicted in the above diagram is described in more detail in the rest of the lesson.
上图中描述的五个阶段中的每一个阶段都将在本课的其余部分进行更详细的描述。

### Analyse and define requirements [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/q26XMjGk480#Analyse-and-define-requirements)

The system's intended services, potential constraints, and goals are established and then defined in detail. These requirements then serve as a product specification, according to which the website is then developed.
建立系统的预期服务、潜在约束和目标，然后详细定义。然后将这些要求用作产品规格，然后根据该规格开发网站。

### Design software [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/q26XMjGk480#Design-software)

The design process entails allocating the requirements realized in the previous stage to different software components by establishing an overall system architecture. Software design involves identifying and describing the fundamental software system abstractions and the relationships amongst them that your website will require.
设计过程需要通过建立一个整体的系统架构，将前一阶段实现的需求分配给不同的软件组件。软件设计包括识别和描述基本的软件系统抽象，以及你的网站所需要的它们之间的关系。

### Implement and test units [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/q26XMjGk480#Implement-and-test-units)

During this stage, the software design is translated to a set of programs or multiple program units. Unit testing involves verifying that each unit meets its specifications.
在这个阶段，软件设计被转化为一组程序或多个程序单元。单元测试包括验证每个单元是否符合其规格。

### Integrate units and test system [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/q26XMjGk480#Integrate-units-and-test-system)

The individual program units are integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure that the software requirements have been met. After testing, the software system is delivered to the customer. In the case of your own website, you would deploy it at this point.
各个程序单元作为一个完整的系统被整合和测试，以确保软件要求得到满足。测试之后，软件系统被交付给客户。就你自己的网站而言，你会在这一点上进行部署。

### Operation and maintenance [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/q26XMjGk480#Operation-and-maintenance)

Normally (although not necessarily), this is the longest life cycle phase. The system is installed and put into practical use. Maintenance involves correcting errors that were not discovered in earlier stages of the life cycle, improving the implementation of system units and enhancing the system's services as new requirements are discovered.
通常情况下（虽然不一定），这是最长的生命周期阶段。系统被安装并投入实际使用。维护工作包括纠正在生命周期早期阶段没有发现的错误，改进系统单元的实施，并在发现新的需求时加强系统的服务。

## Conclusion [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/q26XMjGk480#Conclusion-)

The waterfall model is categorized as a plan-driven process since it requires a detailed plan to be in place before each stage can be executed. This model works best in large organizations that have several people working on large-scale projects which need detailed paperwork and records to coordinate with one another. However, in the case of personal websites or small projects, this approach may prove to be unnecessarily meticulous and extraneous since there is no need to keep elaborate records in that situation.
瀑布模型被归类为计划驱动的过程，因为它要求在每个阶段执行之前都要有详细的计划。这种模式在有几个人从事大型项目的大型组织中效果最好，这些项目需要详细的文书工作和记录来相互协调。然而，在个人网站或小项目的情况下，这种方法可能被证明是不必要的细致和无关紧要的，因为在这种情况下没有必要保持详细的记录。

Now that we have seen an example of how plan-driven processes work, we will move on to look into an example of an agile process in the next lesson and see if it is better suited to web developments on a smaller scale.
既然我们已经看到了计划驱动流程如何工作的示例，我们将在下一课中继续研究敏捷流程的示例，看看它是否更适合较小规模的 Web 开发。
