An overview of the incremental development model of software engineering.
软件工程的增量开发模式概述。

## Introduction [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/RML92RAVKRz#Introduction-)

The incremental development approach is a fundamental agile process that entails interleaving the activities of specification, development, and validation. The system is then developed as a series of versions or _increments_, with each version adding functionality to the previous version.
增量开发方法是一个基本的敏捷过程，需要将规范、开发和验证等活动交织在一起。然后，系统被开发成一系列的版本或增量，每个版本都在前一版本的基础上增加功能。

The underlying idea in the incremental development process is to develop an initial version of your website, open it to feedback, and then incrementally develop newer versions based on this feedback. In this case, the specification, development, and validation phases all happen concurrently and feed into one another.
增量开发过程的基本思想是开发一个网站的初始版本，开放它以获得反馈，然后根据这些反馈逐步开发新版本。在这种情况下，规范、开发和验证阶段都是同时进行的，并相互影响。

Incremental software development is better suited than a waterfall approach to most business and personal systems. This is because incremental development is a more intuitive way of solving problems. It is the equivalent of moving toward a solution in a series of steps, backtracking on mistakes, and iteratively reaching a solution. Moreover, developing the software incrementally means it is cheaper and easier to add changes to it while it is still being developed instead of having to wait for problems to be discovered after undergoing the entire development process.
对于大多数商业和个人系统来说，增量式软件开发比瀑布方法更适合。这是因为增量开发是一种更直观的解决问题的方式。它相当于在一系列的步骤中走向一个解决方案，对错误进行回溯，并迭代地达到一个解决方案。此外，增量开发意味着在软件还在开发的时候就可以更便宜、更容易地对其进行修改，而不是等到经历了整个开发过程后才发现问题。

## Incremental development vs. waterfall model [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/RML92RAVKRz#Incremental-development-vs.-waterfall-model-)

As we have already seen, the incremental development model is more intuitive than the waterfall model for developing the most common website use cases. In addition to this, there are a number of other benefits that incremental development has compared to the waterfall model, and they are enumerated as follows:
正如我们已经看到的，对于开发最常见的网站用例，增量开发模型比瀑布模型更直观。除此之外，增量开发与瀑布模型相比还有很多其他的好处，列举如下：

1.  The cost of accommodating changing customer requirements diminishes significantly in this case as the amount of analysis and documentation that has to be redone is much less than in the waterfall model.
在这种情况下，适应客户需求变化的成本会大大降低，因为需要重新做的分析和文档数量比瀑布模型要少得多。
2.  It is easier to get customer feedback on the development work that has been done since they can comment on physical demonstrations of the software and see how much has been implemented as opposed to judging from software design documents.
更容易得到客户对开发工作的反馈，因为他们可以对软件的实际演示进行评论，看到有多少已经实现，而不是从软件设计文件中判断。
3.  More rapid delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible, even if all of the functionality has not been included. Customers are able to use and gain value from the software earlier than is possible with a waterfall process.
可以更迅速地向客户交付和部署有用的软件，即使没有包括所有的功能。与瀑布流程相比，客户能够更早地使用软件并从中获得价值。

## Conclusion [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/RML92RAVKRz#Conclusion-)

The incremental development model is a much simpler approach that is easily implemented and allows for efficient software development on a small-scale. For websites that are not complex and do not require multiple groups of people to work on them, this approach is the best suited since it allows for a systematic simplicity and efficiency simultaneously.
增量开发模型是一种更简单的方法，易于实现，并允许小规模的高效软件开发。对于不复杂且不需要多组人一起工作的网站，这种方法是最合适的，因为它可以同时实现系统的简单性和效率。

Now that we have discussed both agile and plan-driven processes with examples, we will move on to look into another interesting approach to developing software that can be incorporated within both agile and plan-driven processes in the next lesson.
既然我们已经通过示例讨论了敏捷和计划驱动的流程，我们将继续研究另一种有趣的软件开发方法，该方法可以在下一课中合并到敏捷和计划驱动的流程中。
