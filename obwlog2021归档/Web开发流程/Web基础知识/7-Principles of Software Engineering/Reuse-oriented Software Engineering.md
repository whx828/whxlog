A brief overview of the reuse-oriented software engineering process.
面向重用的软件工程过程的简要概述。

## Introduction [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/m2Y8NA02WZO#Introduction-)

As we have already seen in the frameworks chapter, most software projects require some software reuse when people working on the project know of preexisting designs or codes that are similar to what is required. They look for these, modify them as needed, and incorporate them into their system according to its particular requirements. This is done regardless of the development process that is being used.
正如我们在框架一章中已经看到的，大多数软件项目都需要一些软件重用，当从事项目工作的人知道预先存在的设计或代码与所需的相似时。他们寻找这些东西，根据需要进行修改，并根据其特定的要求将其纳入他们的系统。无论使用的是哪种开发过程，都要这样做。

In recent times, however, software development processes that focus on the reuse of existing software have become widely used. Reuse-oriented approaches rely on reusable software components and an integrating framework for the composition of these components. Sometimes, these components are systems in their own right that may provide specific functionality, much like the frameworks we have previously studied.
然而，在最近，注重现有软件再利用的软件开发过程已被广泛使用。面向重用的方法依赖于可重用的软件组件和用于组成这些组件的集成框架。有时，这些组件本身就是系统，可以提供特定的功能，很像我们之前研究的框架。

## Advantages & disadvantages [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/m2Y8NA02WZO#Advantages-&-disadvantages-)

Reuse-oriented software engineering has the obvious advantage of significantly reducing the actual development that needs to be done from scratch, which in turn ensures faster product delivery.
面向重用的软件工程有一个明显的优势，就是大大减少了需要从头开始的实际开发，这反过来又保证了产品的快速交付。

However, reusing other software also means that the requirements will inevitably have to change according to the specifics of the software being used, which may not be perfectly equipped to cater to the requirements of the software being developed. This also means that there is a significant loss of control over how the software evolves since its evolution then depends on how its third-party components evolve.
然而，重用其他软件也意味着需求将不可避免地要根据所使用的软件的具体情况来改变，而这些软件可能并不完全具备满足所开发的软件的要求。这也意味着对软件的发展失去了很大的控制，因为它的发展取决于第三方组件的发展。

## Conclusion [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/m2Y8NA02WZO#Conclusion-)

Reuse-oriented software engineering is the most prevalent approach to developing software right now. With the introduction of frameworks such as Express and Angular, web development has become significantly simplified, and nuances are provided for complicated code that is required in almost all websites. It is, therefore, a good idea to leverage these nuances when developing an initial website to create sophisticated programs that allow you to understand the functionality you are developing instead of getting intertwined in extraneous details of the code that produces it.
面向重用的软件工程是目前最流行的软件开发方法。随着 Express 和 Angular 等框架的引入，Web 开发变得显著简化，并且为几乎所有网站都需要的复杂代码提供了细微差别。因此，在开发初始网站时利用这些细微差别来创建复杂的程序是一个好主意，这些程序允许您了解正在开发的功能，而不是与生成它的代码的无关细节交织在一起。
