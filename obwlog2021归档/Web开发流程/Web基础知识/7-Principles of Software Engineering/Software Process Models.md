A brief introduction to the process models that can be used when developing a website.
简要介绍一下开发网站时可以使用的流程模型。

## Software processes [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/gx2kMp5k2vZ#Software-processes-)

Now that we have a basic idea of what goes into developing a website and what its multiple components are, we will proceed to discuss the different ways in which we can structure the development process.
现在我们对开发网站的内容以及它的多个组件有一个基本概念，我们将继续讨论构建开发过程的不同方式。

A **software process** is defined as a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software product, such as a website. The software processes we will be discussing in this chapter are all concepts that fall under professional software engineering that entails building large scale web applications. However, these are all important concepts that you should be familiar with if you are looking to take up web development professionally or eventually planning to deploy your website since they provide a methodology to the process that allows you to organize your work into logical stages.
软件过程被定义为导致软件产品（例如网站）生产的一组相关活动。我们将在本章中讨论的软件过程都是属于需要构建大规模 Web 应用程序的专业软件工程的概念。但是，如果您希望从事专业的 Web 开发或最终计划部署您的网站，那么这些都是您应该熟悉的重要概念，因为它们为流程提供了一种方法论，可以让您将工作组织成逻辑阶段。

There are several different software processes that we will discuss in this chapter; however, we will first outline the four fundamental software engineering activities that all of them must comprise of:
本章将讨论几个不同的软件过程；但是，我们将首先概述所有这些过程必须包括的四个基本软件工程活动：

1.  _Software specification_: Defining the intended functionality of the software and potential constraints on its operation. In the case of a starter web application, this would be the stage where you define the features you want to implement on your website.
软件规范：定义软件的预期功能及其操作的潜在限制。对于入门 Web 应用程序，这将是您定义要在网站上实施的功能的阶段。
2.  _Software design and implementation_: Producing the software according to the specifications articulated. This is the stage where the actual application is developed.
软件设计与实现：根据所阐明的规范生产软件。这是开发实际应用程序的阶段。
3.  _Software validation_: Ensuring the software does what users want it to do. During this stage, you make sure the features you wanted to implement have been implemented correctly.
软件验证：确保软件执行用户希望它执行的操作。在此阶段，您要确保您想要实现的功能已正确实现。
4.  _Software evolution_: The ability of the software to adapt with evolving user requirements. This is an ongoing stage where you continuously come up with features that you think would make your application better and implement them.
软件进化：软件适应不断变化的用户需求的能力。这是一个持续的阶段，您将不断提出您认为可以使您的应用程序更好的功能并实现它们。

Although there is no “ideal” software process, and the efficiency of any given approach depends on individual strengths and weaknesses, it is important to understand the standard models that exist in order to know where to begin planning your website.
虽然没有“理想”的软件流程，任何给定方法的效率取决于个人的优势和劣势，但了解现有的标准模型以了解从哪里开始规划您的网站非常重要。

## Categories [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-development-a-primer/gx2kMp5k2vZ#Categories-)

All process models can be categorized as one of the following:
所有过程模型都可以归类为以下之一：

1.  Plan-driven 计划驱动
2.  Agile 敏捷型

A **plan-driven process** is one where all of the process activities are planned in advance, and progress is measured against this plan.
计划驱动的过程是预先计划所有过程活动，并根据该计划衡量进度的过程。

An **agile process** is one where planning is incremental, and it is easier to change the process in accordance with changing customer requirements.
敏捷流程是一种渐进式规划的流程，并且更容易根据不断变化的客户需求来更改流程。

Now that we have defined what a software process is and how any given model can be categorized, let's move on to look into some common models and discuss the specifics of each model!
既然我们已经定义了软件过程是什么以及如何对任何给定模型进行分类，让我们继续研究一些常见模型并讨论每个模型的细节！
