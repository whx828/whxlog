# Logseq Plugin Tabs

[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/pengx17/logseq-plugin-tabs/total.svg)](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-plugin-tabs/releases)

A plugin that let's you to manage your working pages with tabs.

UX is mainly brought from modern browsers:

- normally, if a new page is visited, the current tab will be replaced by the new page
- if you click a page link or a block ref while holding CTRL (or CMD on Mac) key, a new tab will be created, but it is not visited yet
- you can remove the tab by click the remove button in each tab
- you can double-click a tab to pin it. A pinned tab will not be replaced or be removed.
- you can drag & drop to reorder tabs
- tabs info will be persisted in your local storage, so that your tabs will recover even if you re-open the app

## TODO

- [ ] keyboard shortcuts. Eg., CTRL+TAB to switch to next tab, CTRL+SHIFT+TAB to switch to previous tab, CTRL+W to close current tab
